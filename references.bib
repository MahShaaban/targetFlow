The 3T3-L1 cell line is used as an adipocyte differentiation model for the analysis of genes specifically expressed during the differentiation course. This cell model has several applications in obesity and insulin resistance research. We built a data resource to model gene expression of differentiating and mature adipocytes in response to several drugs and gene manipulations. We surveyed the literature survey for microarray datasets of differentiating 3T3-L1 cell line sampled at one or more time points under genetic or pharmacological perturbations. Data and metadata were obtained from the gene expression omnibus. The metadata were manually curated using unified language across the studies. Probe intensities were mapped and collapsed to genes using a reproducible pipeline. Samples were classified into none, genetically or pharmacologically modified. In addition to the clean datasets, two aggregated sets were further homogenized for illustration purposes. The curated datasets are available as an R/Bioconductor experimental data package curatedAdipoArray. The package documents the source code of the data collection, curation and processing. Finally, we used a subset of the data to effectively remove batch effects and reproduce biological observations. Database URL https://bioconductor.org/packages/curatedAdipoArray.},

abstract = {Background: Transcription factor binding to the regulatory region of a gene induces or represses its gene expression. Transcription factors share their binding sites with other factors, co-factors and/or DNA-binding proteins. These proteins form complexes which bind to the DNA as one-units. The binding of two factors to a shared site does not always lead to a functional interaction. Results: We propose a method to predict the combined functions of two factors using comparable binding and expression data (target). We based this method on binding and expression target analysis (BETA), which we re-implemented in R and extended for this purpose. target ranks the factor's targets by importance and predicts the dominant type of interaction between two transcription factors. We applied the method to simulated and real datasets of transcription factor-binding sites and gene expression under perturbation of factors. We found that Yin Yang 1 transcription factor (YY1) and YY2 have antagonistic and independent regulatory targets in HeLa cells, but they may cooperate on a few shared targets. Conclusion: We developed an R package and a web application to integrate binding (ChIP-seq) and expression (microarrays or RNA-seq) data to determine the cooperative or competitive combined function of two transcription factors.},

abstract = {Autophagy, an intracellular degradation process, is essential for maintaining cell homeostasis by removing damaged organelles and proteins under various conditions of stress. In cancer, autophagy has conflicting functions. It plays a key role in protecting against cancerous transformation by maintaining genomic stability against genotoxic components, leading to cancerous transformation. It can also promote cancer cell survival by supplying minimal amounts of nutrients during cancer progression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying how autophagy regulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis are unknown. Here, we show that starvation-induced autophagy promotes Snail (SNAI1) degradation and inhibits EMT and metastasis in cancer cells. Interestingly, SNAI1 proteins were physically associated and colocalized with LC3 and SQSTM1 in cancer cells. We also found a significant decrease in the levels of EMT and metastatic proteins under starvation conditions. Furthermore, ATG7 knockdown inhibited autophagy-induced SNAI1 degradation in the cytoplasm, which was associated with a decrease in SNAI1 nuclear translocation. Moreover, cancer cell invasion and migration were significantly inhibited by starvation-induced autophagy. These findings suggest that autophagy-dependent SNAI1 degradation could specifically regulate EMT and cancer metastasis during tumorigenesis.},

It has also been implicated in the development and differentiation of various cell types including the adipocyte. Several links between adipogenic transcription factors and key autophagy genes has been suggested. In this study, we tried to model the gene expression and their transcriptional regulation during the adipocyte differentiation using high-throughput sequencing datasets of the 3T3-L1 cell model. We applied the gene expression and co-expression analysis to all and the subset of autophagy genes to study the binding, and occupancy patterns of adipogenic factors, co-factors and histone modifications on key autophagy genes. We also analyzed the gene expression of key autophagy genes under different transcription factor knockdown adipocyte cells. We found that a significant percent of the variance in the autophagy gene expression is explained by the differentiation stage of the cell. Adipogenic master regulators, such as CEBPB and PPARG target key autophagy genes directly. In addition, the same factor may also control autophagy gene expression indirectly through autophagy transcription factors such as FOXO1, TFEB or XBP1. Finally, the binding of adipogenic factors is associated with certain patterns of co-factors binding that might modulate the functions. Some of the findings were further confirmed under the knockdown of the adipogenic factors in the differentiating adipocytes. In conclusion, autophagy genes are regulated as part of the transcriptional programs through adipogenic factors either directly or indirectly through autophagy transcription factors during adipogenesis.},

abstract = {Oxidative damage in neurons including glutamate excitotoxicity has been linked to increasing numbers of neuropathological conditions. Under these conditions, cells trigger several different cellular responses such as autophagy, apoptosis, necrosis and senescence. However, the connection between these responses is not well understood. In this study, we found that the 60-kDa BECN1 was specifically degraded to a 40-kDa fragment in hippocampal HT22 cells treated with 5 mM glutamate. Increased BECN1 cleavage was specifically associated with a decrease in cell viability under oxidative stress. Interestingly, this BECN1 cleavage was specifically inhibited by a calpain inhibitor ALLN but was not affected by other protease inhibitors. Also, the BECN1 cleavage was not detected in calpain-4-deficient cell lines. Furthermore, calpain cleaved BECN1 at a specific site between the coiled-coil domain and Bcl2 homology 3 domain, which is associated with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Moreover, some cellular senescence markers, including $\beta$-galactosidase, p21, p27Kip1, p53 and p16INK4A, increased proportionally to those of BECN1 cleaved fragments. These results suggest that calpain-mediated BECN1 cleavage under oxidative conditions is specifically associated with cell death induced by cellular senescence.},

abstract = {One million females are diagnosed worldwide every year with breast cancer, and the mortality rate of these patients remains high. Several treatments, including surgery, are available for breast cancer. $\beta$‑Lapachone ($\beta$‑Lap), a natural quinone compound, has been developed for cancer treatment due to its strong cytotoxic effect through its action on NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)‑dependent activity. However, the mechanism in regards to how $\beta$‑Lap induces cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells is still elusive. In the present study, we showed that $\beta$‑Lap induced apoptotic cell death via activation of protein kinase A (PKA) in NQO1‑overexpressing MDA‑MB‑231 human breast cancer cells. This PKA‑dependent cell death was observed solely in NQO1‑overexpressing 231 cells via the high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cell survival of antioxidant [N‑acetylcysteine (NAC)]‑treated NQO1‑overexpressing 231 cells was significantly recovered, and NQO1‑negative 231 cells did not respond to $\beta$‑Lap. Antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl2 and Bcl‑xL were decreased, while proapoptotic proteins, including cytochrome c, activation of caspase‑3, and cleavage of PARP were increased after $\beta$‑Lap treatment of NQO1‑overexpressing 231 cells. Furthermore, PKA activators, forskolin or dibutyryl‑cAMP, an analog of cAMP, aggravated the $\beta$‑Lap‑induced apoptotic cell death by decreasing antiapoptotic proteins and further activating proapoptotic proteins in NQO1‑positive 231 cells. Treatment with a PKA inhibiter, H89, significantly increased cell viability even in NQO1‑overexpressing cells treated with $\beta$‑Lap. These data showed that $\beta$‑Lap activated PKA via ROS accumulation, subsequently leading to apoptotic cell death in NQO1‑positive breast cancer cells.},

abstract = {3T3-L1 preadipocytes undergo adipogenesis in response to treatment with dexamethaxone, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and insulin (DMI) through activation of several adipogenic transcription factors. Many autophagy-related proteins are also highly activated in the earlier stages of adipogenesis, and the LC3 conjugation system is required for formation of lipid droplets. Here, we investigated the effect of overexpression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 fusion protein on adipogenesis. Overexpression of GFP-LC3 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using poly-l-lysine-assisted adenoviral GFP-LC3 transduction was sufficient to produce intracellular lipid droplets. Indeed, GFP-LC3 overexpression stimulated expression of some adipogenic transcription factors (e.g., C/EBP$\alpha$ or $\beta$, PPAR$\gamma$, SREBP2). In particular, SREBP2 was highly activated in preadipocytes transfected with adenoviral GFP-LC3. Also, phosphorylation of Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) at serine 153, consequently stimulating extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1 activity, was significantly increased during adipogenesis induced by either poly-l-lysine-assisted adenoviral GFP-LC3 transduction or culture in the presence of dexamethasone, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and insulin. Furthermore, RKIP knockdown promoted ERK1 and PPAR$\gamma$ activation, and significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of triacylglycerides in DMI-induced adipogenesis. In conclusion, GFP-LC3 overexpression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stimulates adipocyte differentiation via direct modulation of RKIP-dependent ERK1 activity.},

Currently, few different analysis models are used to determine the quality of data and to quantify the mRNA level across the experimental conditions. Methods We developed an R package to implement methods for quality assessment, analysis and testing qPCR data for statistical significance. Double Delta C T and standard curve models were implemented to quantify the relative expression of target genes from C T in standard qPCR control-group experiments. In addition, calculation of amplification efficiency and curves from serial dilution qPCR experiments are used to assess the quality of the data. Finally, two-group testing and linear models were used to test for significance of the difference in expression control groups and conditions of interest. Results Using two datasets from qPCR experiments, we applied different quality assessment, analysis and statistical testing in the pcr package and compared the results to the original published articles. The final relative expression values from the different models, as well as the intermediary outputs, were checked against the expected results in the original papers and were found to be accurate and reliable. Conclusion The pcr package provides an intuitive and unified interface for its main functions to allow biologist to perform all necessary steps of qPCR analysis and produce graphs in a uniform way.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Ahmed et al. Autophagy contributes to reorganizing intracellular components and forming fat droplets during the adipocyte differentiation. Here, we systematically describe the role of autophagy-related genes and gene sets during the differentiation of adipocytes. We used a public dataset from the European Nucleotide Archive from an RNA-seq experiment in which 3T3-L1 cells were induced by a differentiation induction medium, total RNA was extracted and sequenced at four different time points. Raw reads were aligned to the UCSC mouse reference genome (mm10) using HISAT2, and aligned reads were summarized at the gene or exon level using HTSeq. DESeq2 and DEXSeq were used to model the gene and exon counts and test for differential expression and relative exon usage, respectively. After applying the appropriate transformation, gene counts were used to perform the gene set and pathway enrichment analysis. Data were obtained, processed and annotated using R and Bioconductor. Several autophagy-related genes and autophagy gene sets, as defined in the Gene Ontology, were actively regulated during the course of the adipocyte differentiation. We further characterized these gene sets by clustering thei r members to a few distinct temporal profiles. Other potential functionally related genes were identified using a machine learning procedure. In summary, we characterized the autophagy gene sets and their members to biologically meaningful groups and elected a number of genes to be functionally related based on their expression patterns, suggesting that autophagy plays a critical role in removal of some intracellular components and supply of energy sources for lipid biogenesis during adipogenesis.},

In particular, the loss of RKIP's function in certain types of cancer cells results in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the promotion of cancer metastasis. In addition, RKIP inhibits autophagy by modulating LC3-lipidation and mTORC1. How the RKIP-dependent inhibition of autophagy is linked to EMT and cancer progression is still under investigation. In this study, we investigated the ways by which RKIP interacts with key gene products in EMT and autophagy during the progression of prostate cancer. We first identified the gene products of interest using the corresponding gene ontology terms. The weighted-gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied on a gene expression dataset from three groups of prostate tissues; benign prostate hyperplasia, primary and metastatic cancer. We found two modules of highly co-expressed genes, which were preserved in other independent datasets of prostate cancer tissues. RKIP showed potentially novel interactions with one EMT and seven autophagy gene products (TGFBR1; PIK3C3, PIK3CB, TBC1D25, TBC1D5, TOLLIP, WDR45 and WIPI1). In addition, we identified several upstream transcription modulators that could regulate the expression of these gene products. Finally, we verified some RKIP novel interactions by co-localization using the confocal microscopy analysis in a prostate cancer cell line. To summarize, RKIP interacts with EMT and autophagy as part of the same functional unit in developing prostate cancer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The goal of neighborhood analysis is to find a set of genes (the neighborhood) that is similar to an initial 'seed' set of genes. Neighborhood analysis methods for network data are important in systems biology. If individual network connections are susceptible to noise, it can be advantageous to define neighborhoods on the basis of a robust interconnectedness measure, e.g. the topological overlap measure. Since the use of multiple nodes in the seed set may lead to more informative neighborhoods, it can be advantageous to define multi-node similarity measures. RESULTS: The pairwise topological overlap measure is generalized to multiple network nodes and subsequently used in a recursive neighborhood construction method. A local permutation scheme is used to determine the neighborhood size. Using four network applications and a simulated example, we provide empirical evidence that the resulting neighborhoods are biologically meaningful, e.g. we use neighborhood analysis to identify brain cancer related genes.

abstract = {The prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e., TF regulon) is becoming a widely used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and data sets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are (1) manually curated repositories, (2) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (3) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (4) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression data sets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations and, thereby, downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark data sets. We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions for 1541 human TFs and evaluated how different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities, or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies, with confidence scores, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.},

abstract = {The C. elegans ortholog of mammalian calsyntenins, CASY-1, is an evolutionarily conserved type-I transmembrane protein that is highly enriched in the nervous system. Mammalian calsyntenins are strongly expressed at inhibitory synapses, but their role in synapse development and function is still elusive. Here, we report a crucial role for CASY-1 in regulating GABAergic synaptic transmission at the C. elegans neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The shorter isoforms of CASY-1; CASY-1B and CASY-1C, express and function in GABA motor neurons where they regulate GABA neurotransmission. Using pharmacological, behavioral, electrophysiological, optogenetic and imaging approaches we establish that GABA release is compromised at the NMJ in casy-1 mutants. Further, we demonstrate that CASY-1 is required to modulate the transport of GABAergic synaptic vesicle (SV) precursors through a possible interaction with the SV motor protein, UNC-104/KIF1A. This study proposes a possible evolutionarily conserved model for the regulation of GABA synaptic functioning by calsyntenins.},

abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite advancements and improvements in surgical and medical treatments, the survival rate of lung cancer patients remains frustratingly poor. Local control for early-stage nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has dramatically improved over the last decades for both operable and inoperable patients. However, the molecular mechanisms of NSCLC invasion leading to regional and distant disease spread remain poorly understood. Here, we identify microRNA-224 (miR-224) to be significantly up-regulated in NSCLC tissues, particularly in resected NSCLC metastasis. Increased miR-224 expression promotes cell migration, invasion, and proliferation by directly targeting the tumor suppressors TNFalpha-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) and SMAD4. In concordance with in vitro studies, mouse xenograft studies validated that miR-224 functions as a potent oncogenic miRNA in NSCLC in vivo. Moreover, we found promoter hypomethylation and activated ERK signaling to be involved in the regulation of miR-224 expression in NSCLC. Up-regulated miR-224, thus, facilitates tumor progression by shifting the equilibrium of the partially antagonist functions of SMAD4 and TNFAIP1 toward enhanced invasion and growth in NSCLC. Our findings indicate that targeting miR-224 could be effective in the treatment of certain lung cancer patients.},

abstract = {The prostate is an androgen-sensitive organ that needs proper androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signals for normal development. The progression of prostate diseases, including benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa), also needs proper androgen/AR signals. Tissue recombination studies report that stromal, but not epithelial, AR plays more critical roles via the mesenchymal-epithelial interactions to influence the early process of prostate development. However, in BPH and PCa, much more attention has been focused on epithelial AR roles. However, accumulating evidence indicates that stromal AR is also irreplaceable and plays critical roles in prostate disease progression. Herein, we summarize the roles of stromal AR in the development of normal prostate, BPH, and PCa, with evidence from the recent results of in vitro cell line studies, tissue recombination experiments, and AR knockout animal models. Current evidence suggests that stromal AR may play positive roles to promote BPH and PCa progression, and targeting stromal AR selectively with AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9, may allow development of better therapies with fewer adverse effects to battle BPH and PCa.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell adhesion molecules (CADMs) comprise of a protein family whose functions include maintenance of cell polarity and tumor suppression. Hypo-expression of CADM2 gene expression has been observed in several cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role and mechanisms of CADM2 in HCC remain unclear. METHODS: The expression of CADM2 and miRNA-10b (miR-10b) in HCC tissues and cell lines were detected using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Immunofluorescence was used to detect Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression in HCC cell lines. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine miR-10b binding to CADM2 3'UTR. Wound healing assay and Transwell assay were performed to examine the migration and invasion of HCC cells. RESULTS: We report the effect of CADM2 as a tumor suppressor in HCC. Firstly, we confirmed that CADM2 expression was significantly down regulated in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues according to TCGA data analysis and fresh HCC sample detection. Secondly, overexpression of CADM2 could inhibit EMT process, migratory and invasion ability of HCC cells. Furthermore, the results indicated that CADM2 is a direct target of miR-10b in HCC cells and miR-10b/CADM2 modulates EMT process and migration ability via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) /AKT signaling pathway in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that miR-10b-CADM2-FAK/AKT axis plays an important role in HCC metastasis, which might be a novel potential therapeutic option for HCC treatment.},

Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) regulates Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling against mycobacteria. We analyzed messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of candidate immune genes in skin biopsy specimens from 85 individuals with leprosy. TOLLIP mRNA was highly and specifically correlated with IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra). In a case-control gene-association study with 477 cases and 1021 controls in Nepal, TOLLIP single-nucleotide polymorphism rs3793964 TT genotype was associated with increased susceptibility to leprosy (recessive, P = 1.4 x 10-3) and with increased skin expression of TOLLIP and IL-1Ra. Stimulation of TOLLIP-deficient monocytes with M. leprae produced significantly less IL-1Ra (P {\textless} .001), compared with control. These data suggest that M. leprae upregulates IL-1Ra by a TOLLIP-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of TOLLIP may decrease an individual's susceptibility to leprosy and offer a novel therapeutic target for IL-1-dependent diseases.},

abstract = {Osteoblasts and adipocytes share a common mesenchymal progenitor in the bone marrow. This implies that a reciprocal relationship exists between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Further, cells of osteoblast lineage transdifferentiate into adipocytes under some circumstances. Dysregulation of osteo-adipogenic fate-determination leads to bone diseases such as osteoporosis, accompanied by an increase in bone marrow adipose tissue. Thus, the fine-tuning of osteo-adipogenesis is necessary for bone homeostasis. Osteo-adipogenic progression is governed by a complex crosstalk of extrinsic signals, transcription factors, and epigenetic factors. Long non-protein-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act in part as epigenetic regulators in a broad range of biological activities, such as chromatin organization, transcriptional regulation, post-translational modifications, and histone modification. In this review, we highlight the roles of epigenetic regulators, particularly lncRNAs, in the osteo-adipogenic lineage commitment of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and the adipogenic transdifferentiation of osteoblasts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS Saturated fatty acids (SFA) are widely thought to induce inflammation in adipose tissue (AT), while monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are purported to have the opposite effect; however, it is unclear if individual SFA and MUFA behave similarly. Our goal was to examine adipocyte transcriptional networks regulated by individual SFA (palmitic acid, PA; stearic acid, SA) and MUFA (palmitoleic acid, PMA; oleic acid, OA). METHODS Differentiated preadipocytes were treated with either 250 µM PA, SA, PMA, or OA for 48 h. Gene expression was analyzed using microarrays and real-time RT-PCR. Data were compared with those of a previous study reporting AT gene expression in humans following the consumption of SFA- or MUFA-enriched diets. RESULTS Individual fatty acid treatments had significant effects on adipocyte gene expression. Functional analyses revealed that PA induced the TLR signalling pathway, while PMA had the opposite effect. SA and OA had similar effects, with increases in key metabolic pathways including mTOR and PPAR signalling and a reduction in TLR signalling. Ccl5 was validated as a candidate gene that may mediate the differential inflammatory effects of SFA and MUFA in AT. CONCLUSIONS Individual SFA and MUFA trigger distinct transcriptional responses in differentiated preadipocytes, with inflammatory and metabolic pathways particularly sensitive to these fatty acids.},

abstract = {The obesogen hypothesis states that together with an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended, exposure to environmental compounds early in life or throughout lifetime might have an influence on obesity development. In this work, we propose a new approach for obesogen screening, i.e., the use of transcriptomics in the 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell line. Based on the data from a previous study of our group using a lipid accumulation based adipocyte differentiation assay, several human-relevant obesogenic compounds were selected: reference obesogens (Rosiglitazone, Tributyltin), test obesogens (Butylbenzyl phthalate, butylparaben, propylparaben, Bisphenol A), and non-obesogens (Ethylene Brassylate, Bis (2-ethylhexyl)phthalate). The high stability and reproducibility of the 3T3-L1 gene transcription patterns over different experiments and cell batches is demonstrated by this study. Obesogens and non-obesogen gene transcription profiles were clearly distinguished using hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, a gradual distinction corresponding to differences in induction of lipid accumulation could be made between test and reference obesogens based on transcription patterns, indicating the potential use of this strategy for classification of obesogens. Marker genes that are able to distinguish between non, test, and reference obesogens were identified. Well-known genes involved in adipocyte differentiation as well as genes with unknown functions were selected, implying a potential adipocyte-related function of the latter. Cell-physiological lipid accumulation was well estimated based on transcription levels of the marker genes, indicating the biological relevance of omics data. In conclusion, this study shows the high relevance and reproducibility of this 3T3-L1 based in vitro toxicogenomics tool for classification of obesogens and biomarker discovery. Although the results presented here are promising, further confirmation of the predictive value of the set of candidate biomarkers identified as well as the validation of their clinical role will be needed.},

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) acquires white adipose tissue (WAT) cell features defined as BAT whitening under certain circumstances. The aim of our current study was to investigate the possibility and mechanisms of GC-induced BAT whitening. Here, we showed that one-week dexamethasone (Dex) treatment induced BAT whitening, characterized by lipid droplet accumulation, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, autophagy and ATG7 (autophagy related 7) expression was induced in BAT by Dex, and treatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine or adenovirus-mediated ATG7 knockdown prevented Dex-induced BAT whitening and fat mass gain. Moreover, Dex-increased ATG7 expression and autophagy was mediated by enhanced expression of BTG1 (B cell translocation gene 1, anti-proliferative) that stimulated activity of CREB1 (cAMP response element binding protein 1). The importance of BTG1 in this regulation was further demonstrated by the observed BAT whitening in adipocyte-specific BTG1-overexpressing mice and the attenuated Dex-induced BAT whitening and fat mass gain in mice with BTG1 knockdown in BAT. Taken together, we showed that Dex induces a significant whitening of BAT via BTG1- and ATG7-dependent autophagy, which might contribute to Dex-increased adiposity. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying GC-increased adiposity and possible strategy for preventing GC-induced side effects via the combined use of an autophagy inhibitor.Abbreviations: ACADL: acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, long-chain; ACADM: acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, medium-chain; ACADS: acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, short-chain; ADIPOQ: adiponectin; AGT: angiotensinogen; Atg: autophagy-related; BAT: brown adipose tissue; BTG1: B cell translocation gene 1, anti-proliferative; CEBPA: CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha; CIDEA: cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor, alpha subunit-like effector A; CPT1B: carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b, muscle; CPT2: carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2; CQ: chloroquine; Dex: dexamethasone; eWAT: epididymal white adipose tissue; FABP4: fatty acid binding protein 4, adipocyte; FFAs: free fatty acids; GCs: glucocorticoids; NRIP1: nuclear receptor interacting protein 1; OCR: oxygen consumption rate; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PPARA: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; PPARG: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; PPARGC1A: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha; PRDM16: PR domain containing 16; PSAT1: phosphoserine aminotransferase 1; RB1: RB transcriptional corepressor 1; RBL1/p107: RB transcriptional corepressor like 1; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; sWAT: subcutaneous white adipose tissue; TG: triglycerides; UCP1: uncoupling protein 1 (mitochondrial, proton carrier); WT: wild-type.},

abstract = {Background: The diminished glucose lowering effect of insulin in obesity, called “insulin resistance,” is associated with glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, and other serious maladies. Many publications on this topic have suggested numerous hypotheses on the molecular and cellular disruptions that contribute to the syndrome. However, significant uncertainty remains on the mechanisms of its initiation and long-term maintenance. Scope of review: To simplify insulin resistance analysis, this review focuses on the unifying concept that adipose tissue is a central regulator of systemic glucose homeostasis by controlling liver and skeletal muscle metabolism. Key aspects of adipose function related to insulin resistance reviewed are: 1) the modes by which specific adipose tissues control hepatic glucose output and systemic glucose disposal, 2) recently acquired understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these modes of regulation, and 3) the steps in these pathways adversely affected by obesity that cause insulin resistance. Major conclusions: Adipocyte heterogeneity is required to mediate the multiple pathways that control systemic glucose tolerance. White adipocytes specialize in sequestering triglycerides away from the liver, muscle, and other tissues to limit toxicity. In contrast, brown/beige adipocytes are very active in directly taking up glucose in response to $\beta$ adrenergic signaling and insulin and enhancing energy expenditure. Nonetheless, white, beige, and brown adipocytes all share the common feature of secreting factors and possibly exosomes that act on distant tissues to control glucose homeostasis. Obesity exerts deleterious effects on each of these adipocyte functions to cause insulin resistance.},

abstract = {The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) constitutes dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes and macrophages. This system contributes to various functions that are essential for maintaining homeostasis, activation of innate immunity and bridging it with the adaptive immunity. Consequently, MPS are highly important in bolstering immunity against the pathogens. Although, MPS are the frontline cells in destroying Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), yet the bacterium prefers to reside in the hostile environment of macrophages. Therefore, it may be very interesting to study the struggle between Mtb and MPS to understand the outcome of the disease. In an event when MPS predominates Mtb, the host remains protected. In contrast, the situation becomes devastating when the pathogen tames and tunes the host MPS, which ultimately culminates into tuberculosis (TB). Hence, it becomes extremely crucial to reinvigorate MPS functionality to overwhelm Mtb and eliminate it. In the current article, we discuss the strategies to bolster the function of MPS by exploiting the molecules associated with the innate immunity and highlight the mechanisms involved to overcome the Mtb induced suppression of host immunity. In future, such approaches may provide an insight to develop immuno-therapeutics to treat TB.},

However, the factors that regulate PPAR$\gamma$ and C/EBP$\alpha$ expression during adipogenesis remain largely unclear. Here, we show PTIP, a protein that associates with histone H3K4 methyltransferases, regulates PPAR$\gamma$ and C/EBP$\alpha$ expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and during preadipocyte differentiation. PTIP deletion in MEFs leads to marked decreases of PPAR$\gamma$ expression and PPAR$\gamma$-stimulated C/EBP$\alpha$ expression. Further, PTIP is essential for induction of PPAR$\gamma$ and C/EBP$\alpha$ expression during preadipocyte differentiation. Deletion of PTIP impairs the enrichment of H3K4 trimethylation and RNA polymerase II on PPAR$\gamma$ and C/EBP$\alpha$ promoters. Accordingly, PTIP-/- MEFs and preadipocytes all show striking defects in adipogenesis. Rescue of the adipogenesis defect in PTIP-/- MEFs requires coexpression of PPAR$\gamma$ and C/EBP$\alpha$. Finally, deletion of PTIP in brown adipose tissue significantly reduces tissue weight. Thus, by regulating PPAR$\gamma$ and C/EBP$\alpha$ expression, PTIP plays a critical role in adipogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

BioPlex accurately depicts known complexes, attaining 80{\%}-100{\%} coverage for most CORUM complexes. The network readily subdivides into communities that correspond to complexes or clusters of functionally related proteins. More generally, network architecture reflects cellular localization, biological process, and molecular function, enabling functional characterization of thousands of proteins. Network structure also reveals associations among thousands of protein domains, suggesting a basis for examining structurally related proteins. Finally, BioPlex, in combination with other approaches, can be used to reveal interactions of biological or clinical significance. For example, mutations in the membrane protein VAPB implicated in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis perturb a defined community of interactors.},

abstract = {Long-term exposure to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) agonists such as rosiglitazone induces browning of rodent and human adipocytes; however, the transcriptional mechanisms governing this phenotypic switch in adipocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that rosiglitazone-induced browning of human adipocytes activates a comprehensive gene program that leads to increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Once induced, this gene program and oxidative capacity are maintained independently of rosiglitazone, suggesting that additional browning factors are activated. Browning triggers reprogramming of PPAR$\gamma$ binding, leading to the formation of PPAR$\gamma$ "superenhancers" that are selective for brown-in-white (brite) adipocytes. These are highly associated with key brite-selective genes. Based on such an association, we identified an evolutionarily conserved metabolic regulator, Kruppel-like factor 11 (KLF11), as a novel browning transcription factor in human adipocytes that is required for rosiglitazone-induced browning, including the increase in mitochondrial oxidative capacity. KLF11 is directly induced by PPAR$\gamma$ and appears to cooperate with PPAR$\gamma$ in a feed-forward manner to activate and maintain the brite-selective gene program.},

Prep1 acts at a stage preceding the activation of the differentiation machinery because its DR makes cells more prone to adipogenic differentiation even in the absence of the adipogenic inducers. Prep1 DR expands the DNA binding landscape of C/EBP$\beta$ (CCAAT enhancer binding protein $\beta$) without affecting its expression or activation. The data indicate that Prep1 normally acts by restricting DNA binding of transcription factors to adipogenic enhancers, in particular C/EBP$\beta$.},

In this study, we find that the GSK3$\beta$-pSer9 level is associated with the expression of Slug in non-small cell lung cancer. GSK3$\beta$-mediated phosphorylation of Slug facilitates Slug protein turnover. Proteomic analysis reveals that the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) interacts with wild-type Slug (wtSlug). Knockdown of CHIP stabilizes the wtSlug protein and reduces Slug ubiquitylation and degradation. In contrast, nonphosphorylatable Slug-4SA is not degraded by CHIP. The accumulation of nondegradable Slug may further lead to the repression of E-cadherin expression and promote cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis.

abstract = {Motivation: To date, gene set analysis approaches primarily focus on identifying differentially expressed gene sets (pathways). Methods for identifying differentially coexpressed pathways also exist but are mostly based on aggregated pairwise correlations or other pairwise measures of coexpression. Instead, we propose Gene Sets Net Correlations Analysis (GSNCA), a multivariate differential coexpression test that accounts for the complete correlation structure between genes.Results: In GSNCA, weight factors are assigned to genes in proportion to the genes' cross-correlations (intergene correlations). The problem of finding the weight vectors is formulated as an eigenvector problem with a unique solution. GSNCA tests the null hypothesis that for a gene set there is no difference in the weight vectors of the genes between two conditions. In simulation studies and the analyses of experimental data, we demonstrate that GSNCA captures changes in the structure of genes' cross-correlations rather than differences in the averaged pairwise correlations. Thus, GSNCA infers differences in coexpression networks, however, bypassing method-dependent steps of network inference. As an additional result from GSNCA, we define hub genes as genes with the largest weights and show that these genes correspond frequently to major and specific pathway regulators, as well as to genes that are most affected by the biological difference between two conditions. In summary, GSNCA is a new approach for the analysis of differentially coexpressed pathways that also evaluates the importance of the genes in the pathways, thus providing unique information that may result in the generation of novel biological hypotheses. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author 2013.},

abstract = {Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most lethal form of thyroid neoplasia and represents an end stage of thyroid tumor progression. No effective treatment exists so far. In this study, we analyzed the miRNA expression profiles of 11 ATC by microarrays and their relationship with the mRNA expression profiles of the same 11 ATC samples. ATC show distinct miRNA expression profiles compared to other less aggressive thyroid tumor types. ATC show 18 commonly deregulated miRNA compared to normal thyroid tissue (17 downregulated and 1 upregulated miRNA). First, the analysis of a combined approach of the mRNA gene expression and of the bioinformatically predicted mRNA targets of the deregulated miRNA suggested a role for these regulations in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in ATC. Second, the direct interaction between one of the upregulated mRNA target, the LOX gene which is an EMT key player, and a downregulated miRNA, the miR-29a, was experimentally validated by a luciferase assay in HEK cell. Third, we confirmed that the ATC tissue is composed of about 50{\%} of tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and suggested, by taking into account our data and published data, their most likely direct or paracrine intercommunication between them and the thyroid tumor cells, amplifying the tumor aggressiveness. Finally, we demonstrated by in situ hybridization a specific thyrocyte localization of 3 of the deregulated miRNA: let-7g, miR-29a and miR-30e and we pointed out the importance of identifying the cell type localization before drawing any conclusion on the physiopathological role of a given gene.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as important posttranscriptional regulators involved in various biological and pathological processes of cells, but their association with tumor chemoresistance has not been fully understood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We detected miR-27a expression in two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549 and A549/CDDP, and then investigated the effects of miR-27a on the metastasis and the chemosensitivity of cancer cells, using both gain- and loss-of-function studies. The correlation between miR-27a level and chemoresistance was further investigated in clinical lung adenocarcinoma specimens.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: miR-27a was significantly up-regulated in cisplatin-resistant lung adenocarcinoma A549/CDDP cells compared with parental A549 cells. miR-27a regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in vitro and modulates response of lung adenocarcinoma cells to cisplatin in vivo. Further studies identified Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP) as a direct and functional target of miR-27a. Small interfering RNA-mediated RKIP knockdown revealed similar effects as that of ectopic miR-27a expression, while overexpression of RKIP attenuated the function of miR-27a in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Increased miR-27a expression was also detected in tumor tissues sampled from lung adenocarcinoma patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and was proved to be correlated with low expression of RKIP, decreased sensitivity to cisplatin, and poor prognosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that up-regulation of miR-27a could suppress RKIP expression and in turn contribute to chemoresistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to cisplatin.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To investigate the involvement of activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) in human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts (HTFs) transdifferentiation and fibrosis. METHODS (1) Cultured HTFs were treated with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-$\beta$1) at different concentrations for different durations, mRNA expression of ALK5 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) while protein expression of ALK5, $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$-SMA), and extracellular matrix deposition including fibronectin (FN) and collagen I (Col1) was assessed by western blot. HTFs with or without TGF-$\beta$1 were also treated with an ALK5 activity inhibitor, SB-431542, and fibrosis-related genes were assessed. (2) HTFs were transduced with ALK5 lentivirus (ALK5-OE group) or empty lentivirus (NC-OE) with or without the treatment of SB-431542. Protein expression of ALK5, $\alpha$-SMA, FN, and Col1 was evaluated. (3) HTFs in the ALK5-OE group and NC-OE group were subjected to a scratch-wound assay and their migratory activities assessed. RESULTS (1) TGF-$\beta$1, in a concentration-dependent manner, upregulated ALK5 and PAI-1 expressions in the HTFs, which peaked between 24 and 36 h. These changes were associated with increases in protein levels of FN, Col1, and $\alpha$-SMA. These TGF-$\beta$1 effects were blocked by the ALK5 inhibitor SB-431542. (2) Similarly, overexpression of ALK5 by lentiviral vector significantly increased protein expression of $\alpha$-SMA, FN, and Col1. Addition of TGF-$\beta$1 to the ALK5-OE cells did not produce additional expression of any of the marker proteins. The upregulation of extracellular matrix and $\alpha$-SMA can be reduced by SB-431542. (3) In ALK5-OE group, HTFs migration was significantly increased compared with normal control and TGF-$\beta$1 could still promote ALK5-OE cells migration. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that ALK5 is an important mediator of HTFs fibrosis. ALK5 is a potential therapeutic target to suppress scar formation after filtration surgery.},

abstract = {Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. Herein we discover that the key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), but not the related isoform PKM1, is methylated by co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). PKM2 methylation reversibly shifts the balance of metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells. Oxidative phosphorylation depends on mitochondrial calcium concentration, which becomes critical for cancer cell survival when PKM2 methylation is blocked. By interacting with and suppressing the expression of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP 3 Rs), methylated PKM2 inhibits the influx of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria. Inhibiting PKM2 methylation with a competitive peptide delivered by nanoparticles perturbs the metabolic energy balance in cancer cells, leading to a decrease in cell proliferation, migration and metastasis. Collectively, the CARM1-PKM2 axis serves as a metabolic reprogramming mechanism in tumorigenesis, and inhibiting PKM2 methylation generates metabolic vulnerability to InsP 3 R-dependent mitochondrial functions.},

Recent studies have indicated the existence of specific receptors, such as p62, which link ubiquitinated targets to autophagosomal degradation pathways. Here we show that NBR1 (neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1) is an autophagy receptor containing LC3- and ubiquitin (Ub)-binding domains. NBR1 is recruited to Ub-positive protein aggregates and degraded by autophagy depending on an LC3-interacting region (LIR) and LC3 family modifiers. Although NBR1 and p62 interact and form oligomers, they can function independently, as shown by autophagosomal clearance of NBR1 in p62-deficient cells. NBR1 was localized to Ub-positive inclusions in patients with liver dysfunction, and depletion of NBR1 abolished the formation of Ub-positive p62 bodies upon puromycin treatment of cells. We propose that NBR1 and p62 act as receptors for selective autophagosomal degradation of ubiquitinated targets. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We propose the hypothesis that loss of estrogen receptor function which leads to endocrine resistance in breast cancer, also results in trans-differentiation from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype that is responsible for increased aggressiveness and metastatic propensity. siRNA mediated silencing of the estrogen receptor in MCF7 breast cancer cells resulted in estrogen/tamoxifen resistant cells (pII) with altered morphology, increased motility with rearrangement and switch from a keratin/actin to a vimentin based cytoskeleton, and ability to invade simulated components of the extracellular matrix. Phenotypic profiling using an Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip indicated geometric fold changes ≥ 3 in approximately 2500 identifiable unique sequences, with about 1270 of these being up-regulated in pII cells. Changes were associated with genes whose products are involved in cell motility, loss of cellular adhesion and interaction with the extracellular matrix. Selective analysis of the data also showed a shift from luminal to basal cell markers and increased expression of a wide spectrum of genes normally associated with mesenchymal characteristics, with consequent loss of epithelial specific markers. Over-expression of several peptide growth factors and their receptors are indicative of an increased contribution to the higher proliferative rates of pII cells as well as aiding their potential for metastatic activity. Signalling molecules that have been identified as key transcriptional drivers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition were also found to be elevated in pII cells. These data support our hypothesis that induced loss of estrogen receptor in previously estrogen/antiestrogen sensitive cells is a trigger for the concomitant loss of endocrine dependence and onset of a series of possibly parallel events that changes the cell from an epithelial to a mesenchymal type. Inhibition of this transition through targeting of specific mediators may offer a useful supplementary strategy to circumvent the effects of loss of endocrine sensitivity.},

abstract = {The regions bound by sequence-specific transcription factors can be highly variable across different cell types despite the static nature of the underlying genome sequence. This has been partly attributed to changes in chromatin accessibility, but a systematic picture has been hindered by the lack of large-scale data sets. Here, we use 456 binding experiments for 119 regulators and 84 chromatin maps generated by the ENCODE in six human cell types, and relate those to a global map of regulatory motif instances for these factors. We find specific and robust chromatin state preferences for each regulator beyond the previously reported open-chromatin association, suggesting a much richer chromatin landscape beyond simple accessibility. The preferentially bound chromatin states of regulators were enriched for sequence motifs of regulators relative to all states, suggesting that these preferences are at least partly encoded by the genomic sequence. Relative to all regions bound by a regulator, however, regulatory motifs were surprisingly depleted in the regulator's preferentially bound states, suggesting additional non-sequence-specific binding beyond the level predicted by the regulatory motifs. Such permissive binding was largely restricted to open-chromatin regions showing histone modification marks characteristic of active enhancer and promoter regions, whereas open-chromatin regions lacking such marks did not show permissive binding. Lastly, the vast majority of cobinding of regulator pairs is predicted by the chromatin state preferences of individual regulators. Overall, our results suggest a joint role of sequence motifs and specific chromatin states beyond mere accessibility in mediating regulator binding dynamics across different cell types. {\textcopyright} 2013, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Thus, we assessed whether TGF-$\alpha$ overexpression and TGF-$\beta$ signaling inactivation cooperate in hepatocarcinogenesis using an in vivo mouse model, MT1/TGFa;AlbCre/Tgfbr2 flx/flx mice ("TGFa;Tgfbr2 hepko "), which overexpresses TGF-$\alpha$ and lacks a TGF-$\beta$ receptor in the liver. TGF-$\beta$ signaling inactivation did not alter the frequency or number of cancers in mice with overexpression of TGF-$\alpha$. However, the tumors in the TGFa;Tgfbr2 hepko mice displayed increased proliferation and increased cdk2, cyclin E and cyclin A expression as well as  decreased Cdkn1a/p21 expression compared to normal liver and compared to the cancers arising in the TGF-$\alpha$ overexpressing mice with intact TGF-$\beta$ receptors. Increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression was also present in the tumors from the TGFa;Tgfbr2 hepko mice and correlated with downregulated Raf kinase inhibitor protein expression, which is a common molecular event in human HCC.

Atg9 loss also resulted in aberrant adult midgut morphology with dramatically enlarged enterocytes. Interestingly, inhibiting the TOR signaling pathway rescued the midgut defects of the Atg9 mutants. In addition, Atg9 interacted with PALS1-associated tight junction protein (Patj), which associates with TSC2 to regulate TOR activity. Depletion of Atg9 caused a marked decrease in TSC2 levels.

Recent advances in genomic technologies and computational modeling have revolutionized our ability to construct models of TRNs. Here, we survey current computational methods for inferring TRN models using genome-scale data. We discuss their advantages and limitations. We summarize representative TRNs constructed using genome-scale data in both normal and disease development. We discuss lessons learned about the structure/function relationship of TRNs, based on examining various large-scale TRN models. Finally, we outline some open questions regarding TRNs, including how to improve model accuracy by integrating complementary data types, how to infer condition-specific TRNs, and how to compare TRNs across conditions and species in order to understand their structure/function relationship.},

abstract = {The acquisition of metastasis potential is a critical point for malignant tumors. Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24) is a potential tumor suppress gene and frequently down-regulated in malignant tumors. It has been implicated that overexpression of MDA-7 led to proliferation inhibition in many types of human tumor. Invasion is an important process which is potential to promote tumor metastasis. However, the role and potential molecular mechanism of mda-7/IL-24 to inhibit the invasion of human melanoma cancer is not fully clear. In this report, we identified a solid role for mda-7/IL-24 in invasion inhibition of human melanoma cancer LiBr cells, including decreasing of adhesion and invasion in vitro, blocking cell cycle, down-regulating the expression of ICAM-1, MMP-2/9, CDK1, the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, NF-$\kappa$B and AP-1 transcription activity. Meanwhile, there was an increased expression of PTEN in mda-7/IL-24 over-expression LiBr cells. Our results demonstrated that mda-7/IL-24 is a potential invasion suppress gene, which inhibits the invasion of LiBr cells by the down-regulation of ICAM-1, MMP-2/9, PTEN, and CDK1 expression. The molecular pathways involved were the MAPK/ERK, PI3K-Akt, NF-$\kappa$B, and AP-1. These findings suggest that mda-7/IL-24 may be used as a possible therapeutic strategy for human melanoma cancer.},

abstract = {When cells of the established preadipose line 3T3-L1 enter a resting state, they accumulate triglyceride and convert to adipose cells. The adipose conversion is brought about by a large increase in the rate of triglyceride synthesis, as measured by the incorporation rate of labeled palmitate, acetate, and glucose. In a resting 3T3 subline which does not undergo the adipose conversion, the rate of triglyceride synthesis from these precursors is very low, and similar to that of growing 3T3-L1 cells, before their adipose conversion begins. If 3T3-L1 cells incorporate bromodeoxyuridine during growth, triglyceride synthesis does not increase when the cells reach a stationary state, and triglycerides do not accumulate. As would be expected from their known actions on tissue adipose cells, lipogenic and lipolytic hormones and drugs affect the rate of synthesis and accumulation of triglyceride by 3T3-L1 cells, but in contrast to bromodeoxyuridine, these modulating agents do not seem to affect the proportion of cells which undergoes the adipose conversion. Insulin markedly increases the rate of synthesis and accumulation of triglyceride by fatty 3T3-L1 cells, and produces a related increase in cell protein content. Of 20 randomly selected clones isolated from the original 3T3 stock, 19 are able to convert to adipose cells. The probability of such a conversion varies greatly among the different clones, in most cases being much lower than for 3T3-L1; but once the conversion takes place, the adipose cells produced from all of the 19 clones appear similar. The adipose conversion would seem to depend on an on-off switch, which is on with a different probability in different clones. This probability is quasistably inherited by the clonal progeny. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can selectively induce apoptosis of cancer cells and is verified effective to various cancers. However, a variety of breast cancer cell lines are resistant to TRAIL and the mechanisms of resistance are largely unknown. In our present experiment, we successfully utilized breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 to establish TRAIL-resistant cell line. We found resistance to TRAIL could induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance invasiveness. We further demonstrated PTEN was down-regulated in TRAIL-resistant cells. Silencing miR-221, PTEN expression was up-regulated, the process of EMT could be reversed, and the ability of migration and invasion were correspondingly weakened. We also demonstrated knockdown of miR-221 could reverse resistance to TRAIL partially by targeting PTEN. Our findings suggest that resistance to TRAIL could induce EMT and enhance invasiveness by suppressing PTEN via miR-221. Re-expression of miR-221 or targeting PTEN might serve as potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of Trail-resistant breast cancer.},

abstract = {The major function of adipocytes is to store triacylglycerol in periods of energy excess and to mobilize this energy during times of deprivation. The short-term control of these lipogenic and lipolytic processes is carefully modulated by hormonal signals from the bloodstream, which provide an inventory of the body's metabolic state. Long-term changes in fat storage needs are accomplished by altering both the size and number of fat cells within the body because terminally differentiated adipocytes cannot divide. Alterations in the number of fat cells within the body must be accomplished by the differentiation of preadipocytes, which act as the renewable source of adipocytes. Our understanding of the events that occur during preadipocyte differentiation has advanced considerably in the last few years and has relied mainly on the use of tissue culture models of adipogenesis. This article will discuss the various models used for studying the preadipocyte differentiation process, with the mouse 3T3-L1 cell culture line described in detail. We focus on those genetic events that link effectors to induction of adipocyte gene expression.},

Cells can also undergo partial transitions to attain a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype that has maximum cellular plasticity and allows migration of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) as a cluster. Hence, deciphering the molecular players helping to maintain the hybrid E/M phenotype may inform anti-metastasis strategies. Here, we devised a mechanism-based mathematical model to couple the transcription factor OVOL with the core EMT regulatory network miR-200/ZEB that acts as a three-way switch between the E, E/M and M phenotypes. We show that OVOL can modulate cellular plasticity in multiple ways - restricting EMT, driving MET, expanding the existence of the hybrid E/M phenotype and turning both EMT and MET into two-step processes. Our theoretical framework explains the differences between the observed effects of OVOL in breast and prostate cancer, and provides a platform for investigating additional signals during metastasis.},

In a recent study we showed that most visceral WAT but no subcutaneous WAT arises from cells expressing the Wilms' tumor 1 (Wt1) gene late in mouse gestation.(1) Wt1 continues to be expressed in visceral WAT progenitors into adult life. We also showed that visceral WAT is lined by a mesothelium and provided evidence that this structure is the source of adipocytes. Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that there is heterogeneity in the visceral progenitors, such that there are Wt1-expressing and non-expressing subsets, the relative proportions of which vary between depots. This raises the enticing prospect that the adipocytes arising from these progenitor subsets may have different properties and our preliminary data support this notion. Finally, evidence from our study and one from Spiegelman's group(2) suggests that Wt1 is not just a marker but regulates visceral WAT identity and the progenitor population. We discuss the implications of this work and some of the questions and future directions that arise from it.},

abstract = {ADAM17 and its inhibitor TIMP3 are involved in nephropathy, but their role in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is unclear. Diabetic Timp3-/- mice showed increased albuminuria, increased membrane thickness and mesangial expansion. Microarray profiling uncovered a significant reduction of Foxo1 expression in diabetic Timp3-/- mice compared to WT, along with FoxO1 target genes involved in autophagy, while STAT1, a repressor of FoxO1 transcription, was increased. Re-expression of Timp3 in Timp3-/- mesangial cells rescued the expression of Foxo1 and its targets, and decreased STAT1 expression to control levels; abolishing STAT1 expression led to a rescue of FoxO1, evoking a role of STAT1 in linking Timp3 deficiency to FoxO1. Studies on kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic nephropathy confirmed a significant reduction in TIMP3, FoxO1 and FoxO1 target genes involved in autophagy compared to controls, while STAT1 expression was strongly increased. Our study suggests that loss of TIMP3 is a hallmark of DKD in human and mouse models and designates TIMP3 as a new possible therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy. Loss of TIMP3 is a hallmark of diabetic kidney disease in human and mouse models. Concomitant STAT1-dependent loss of FoxO1 activity modulates expression of oxidative and protective autophagy genes and results in glomeruli damage. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {Combinatorial activation of PI3-kinase and RAS signaling occurs frequently in advanced prostate cancer and is associated with adverse patient outcome. We now report that the oncogenic Ets variant 4 (Etv4) promotes prostate cancer metastasis in response to coactivation of PI3-kinase and Ras signaling pathways in a genetically engineered mouse model of highly penetrant, metastatic prostate cancer. Using an inducible Cre driver to simultaneously inactivate Pten while activating oncogenic Kras and a fluorescent reporter allele in the prostate epithelium, we performed lineage tracing in vivo to define the temporal and spatial occurrence of prostate tumors, disseminated tumor cells, and metastases. These analyses revealed that though disseminated tumors cells arise early following the initial occurrence of prostate tumors, there is a significant temporal lag in metastasis, which is temporally coincident with the up-regulation of Etv4 expression in primary tumors. Functional studies showed that knockdown of Etv4 in a metastatic cell line derived from the mouse model abrogates the metastatic phenotype but does not affect tumor growth. Notably, expression and activation of ETV4, but not other oncogenic ETS genes, is correlated with activation of both PI3-kinase and Ras signaling in human prostate tumors and metastases. Our findings indicate that ETV4 promotes metastasis in prostate tumors that have activation of PI3-kinase and Ras signaling, and therefore, ETV4 represents a potential target of therapeutic intervention for metastatic prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma-cell neoplastic disorder arising from an indolent premalignant disease known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MM is a biologically complex heterogeneous disease reflected by its variable clinical responses of patients receiving the same treatment. Therefore, a molecular identification of stage-specific biomarkers will support a more individualized precise diagnostic/prognostic approach, an effective therapeutic regime, and will assist in the identification of novel therapeutic molecular targets. The metastatic suppressor/anti-resistance factor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is poorly expressed in the majority of cancers and is often almost absent in metastatic tumors. RKIP inhibits the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 and the NF-$\kappa$B pathways. Whereby all tumors examined exhibited low levels of RKIP, in contrast, our recent findings demonstrated that RKIP is overexpressed primarily in its inactive phosphorylated form in MM cell lines and patient-derived tumor tissues. The underlying mechanism of RKIP overexpression in MM, in contrast to other tumors, is not known. We examined transcriptomic datasets on Oncomine platform (Life Technologies) for the co-expression of RKIP and other gene products in both pre-MM and MM. The transcription of several gene products was found to be either commonly overexpressed (i.e., RKIP, Bcl-2, and DR5) or underexpressed (i.e., Bcl-6 and TNFR2) in both pre-MM and MM. Noteworthy, a significant inverse correlation of differentially expressed pro-apoptotic genes was observed in pre-MM: overexpression of Fas and TNF-$\alpha$ and underexpression of YY1 versus expression of anti-apoptotic genes in MM: overexpression of YY1 and underexpression of Fas and TNF-$\alpha$. Based on the analysis on mRNA levels and reported studies on protein levels of the above various genes, we have constructed various schemes that illustrate the possible cross-talks between RKIP (active/inactive) and the identified gene products that underlie the mechanism of RKIP overexpression in MM. Clearly, such cross-talks would need to be experimentally validated in both MM cell lines and patient-derived tumor tissues. If validated, the differential molecular signatures between pre-MM and MM might lead to a more precise diagnosis/prognosis of the disease and disease stages and will also identify novel molecular therapeutic targets for pre-MM and MM.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. Apoptosis represents a key anti-cancer therapeutic effector mechanism. During apoptosis, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) typically kills cells even in the absence of caspase activity. Caspase activity can also have a variety of unwanted consequences that include DNA damage. We therefore investigated whether MOMP-induced caspase-independent cell death (CICD) might be a better way to kill cancer cells. We find that cells undergoing CICD display potent pro-inflammatory effects relative to apoptosis. Underlying this, MOMP was found to stimulate NF-$\kappa$B activity through the downregulation of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Strikingly, engagement of CICD displays potent anti-tumorigenic effects, often promoting complete tumour regression in a manner dependent on intact immunity. Our data demonstrate that by activating NF-$\kappa$B, MOMP can exert additional signalling functions besides triggering cell death. Moreover, they support a rationale for engaging caspase-independent cell death in cell-killing anti-cancer therapies.},

We find that the specific locations of most such elements differ between the two models, including at orthologous loci with similar expression patterns. Based on sequence analysis and reporter assays, we show that these differences are determined, in part, by evolutionary turnover of transcription factor motifs in the genome sequences and that this turnover may be facilitated by the presence of multiple distal regulatory elements at adipogenesis-dependent loci. We also utilize the close relationship between open chromatin marks and transcription factor motifs to identify and validate PLZF and SRF as regulators of adipogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR is currently the most sensitive method for the detection of low-abundance mRNAs. Two relative quantitative methods have been adopted: the standard curve method and the comparative C(T) method. The latter is used when the amplification efficiency of a reference gene is equal to that of the target gene; otherwise the standard curve method is applied. Based on the simulation of kinetic process of real-time PCR, we have developed a new method for quantitation and normalization of gene transcripts. In our method, the amplification efficiency for each individual reaction is calculated from the kinetic curve, and the initial amount of gene transcript is derived and normalized. Simulation demonstrated that our method is more accurate than the comparative C(T) method and would save more time than the relative standard curve method. We have used the new method to quantify gene expression levels of nine two-pore potassium channels. The relative levels of gene expression revealed by our quantitative method were broadly consistent with those estimated by routine RT-PCR, but the results also showed that amplification efficiencies varied from gene to gene and from sample to sample. Our method provides a simple and accurate approach to quantifying gene expression level with the advantages that neither construction of standard curve nor validation experiments are needed.},

abstract = {Stimulation of $\beta$‐adrenergic receptors ($\beta$ARs) provides the most efficient physiological mechanism to enhance contraction and relaxation of the heart. Activation of $\beta$ARs allows rapid enhancement of myocardial function in order to fuel the muscles for running and fighting in a fight‐or‐flight response. Likewise, $\beta$ARs become activated during cardiovascular disease in an attempt to counteract the restrictions of cardiac output. However, long‐term stimulation of $\beta$ARs increases the likelihood of cardiac arrhythmias, adverse ventricular remodelling, decline of cardiac performance and premature death, thereby limiting the use of $\beta$AR agonists in the treatment of heart failure. Recently the endogenous Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) was found to activate $\beta$AR signalling of the heart without adverse effects. This review will summarize the current knowledge on RKIP‐driven compared to receptor‐mediated signalling in cardiomyocytes. Emphasis is given to the differential effects of RKIP on $\beta$₁‐ and $\beta$₂‐ARs and their downstream targets, the regulation of myocyte calcium cycling and myofilament activity.

abstract = {DNA methylation has an important role in the development of carcinomas. As a metastasis suppressor gene, Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) suppresses tumor cell invasion and metastasis. In the present study, the associations between RKIP protein expression and promoter methylation with clinicopathological parameters, prognosis and survival rates in gastric adenocarcinoma were investigated. RKIP protein expression and promoter methylation were measured in 135 cases of surgically resected gastric adenocarcinoma specimens and corresponding normal tissues using immunohistochemistry and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to analyze the patient survival rate. Prognostic factors were determined using multivariate Cox analysis. RKIP promoter methylation was detected in 48.9{\%} of gastric carcinoma tissues and 5.17{\%} of adjacent tissues (P{\textless}0.05). RKIP protein expression was detected in 43.0{\%} of gastric carcinoma tissues and 91.1{\%} of adjacent tissues (P{\textless}0.05). The protein expression levels and promoter methylation of RKIP were shown to correlate with pathological staging, Union for International Cancer Control-stage, tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis (P{\textless}0.05). In addition, the protein expression of RKIP in gastric carcinomas was demonstrated to be associated with promoter methylation of RKIP. Survival analysis of gastric carcinoma patients revealed that promoter methylation in RKIP-positive tumors correlated with a significantly shorter survival time when compared with RKIP-negative tumors (P=0.0002, using the log-rank test). Using multivariate Cox analysis, promoter methylation of RKIP was shown to be an independent prognostic factor (P=0.033). These results indicated that abnormal promoter methylation of RKIP may be one cause of downregulated RKIP expression. Downregulation of RKIP expression was shown to correlate with the incidence and development of gastric carcinomas. Thus, abnormal promoter methylation of RKIP may be a valuable biomarker for estimating gastric carcinoma prognosis.},

abstract = {The application of functional genomic analysis of breast cancer metastasis has led to the identification of a growing number of organ-specific metastasis genes, which often function in concert to facilitate different steps of the metastatic cascade. However, the gene regulatory network that controls the expression of these metastasis genes remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a computational approach for the deconvolution of transcriptional networks to discover master regulators of breast cancer bone metastasis. Several known regulators of breast cancer bone metastasis such as Smad4 and HIF1 were identified in our analysis. Experimental validation of the networks revealed BACH1, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, as the common regulator of several functional metastasis genes, including MMP1 and CXCR4. Ectopic expression of BACH1 enhanced the malignance of breast cancer cells, and conversely, BACH1 knockdown significantly reduced bone metastasis. The expression of BACH1 and its target genes was linked to the higher risk of breast cancer recurrence in patients. This study established BACH1 as the master regulator of breast cancer bone metastasis and provided a paradigm to identify molecular determinants in complex pathological processes.},

abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a causative factor of inflammatory bowel diseases. ER stress mediators, including CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP), are elevated in intestinal epithelia from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. The present study arose from the question of how chemical ER stress and CHOP protein were associated with nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B)-mediated epithelial inflammatory response. In a human intestinal epithelial cell culture model, chemical ER stresses induced proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression and the nuclear translocation of CHOP protein. CHOP was positively involved in ER-activated IL-8 production and was negatively associated with expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$). ER stress-induced IL-8 production was enhanced by NF-$\kappa$B activation that was negatively regulated by PPAR$\gamma$. Mechanistically, ER stress-induced CHOP suppressed PPAR$\gamma$ transcription by sequestering C/EBP$\beta$ and limiting availability of C/EBP$\beta$ binding to the PPAR$\gamma$ promoter. Due to the CHOP-mediated regulation of PPAR$\gamma$ action, ER stress can enhance proinflammatory NF-$\kappa$B activation and maintain an increased level of IL-8 production in human intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast, PPAR$\gamma$ was a counteracting regulator of gut inflammatory response through attenuation of NF-$\kappa$B activation. The collective results support the view that balances between CHOP and PPAR$\gamma$ are crucial for epithelial homeostasis, and disruption of these balances in mucosal ER stress can etiologically affect the progress of human inflammatory bowel diseases.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) synthase 2 (NOS2), a major inflammatory protein, modulates disease progression via NO in a number of pathologies, including cancer. The role of NOS2-derived NO is not only flux-dependent, which is higher in mouse vs human cells, but also varies based on spatial and temporal distribution both within tumor cells and in the tumor microenvironment. NO donors have been utilized to mimic NO flux conditions and to investigate the effects of varied NO concentrations. As a wide range of effects mediated by NO and other nitrogen oxides such as nitroxyl (HNO) have been elucidated, multiple NO- and HNO-releasing compounds have been developed as potential therapeutics, including as tumor modulators. One of the challenges is to determine differences in biomarker expression from extracellular vs intracellular generation of NO or HNO. Taking advantage of new NO and HNO releasing agents, we have characterized the gene expression profile of estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells following exposure to aspirin, the NO donor DEA/NO, the HNO donor IPA/NO andtheir intracellularly-activated prodrug conjugates DEA/NO-aspirin and IPA/NO-aspirin. Comparison of the gene expression profiles demonstrated that several genes were uniquely expressed with respect to NO or HNO, such as miR-21, HSP70, cystathionine $\gamma$-lyase and IL24. These findings provide insight into targets and pathways that could be therapeutically exploited by the redox related species NO and HNO.},

abstract = {Proteins function mainly through interactions, especially with DNA and other proteins. While some large-scale interaction networks are now available for a number of model organisms, their experimental generation remains difficult. Consequently, interolog mapping--the transfer of interaction annotation from one organism to another using comparative genomics--is of significant value. Here we quantitatively assess the degree to which interologs can be reliably transferred between species as a function of the sequence similarity of the corresponding interacting proteins. Using interaction information from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Helicobacter pylori, we find that protein-protein interactions can be transferred when a pair of proteins has a joint sequence identity {\textgreater}80{\%} or a joint E-value {\textless}10(-70). (These "joint" quantities are the geometric means of the identities or E-values for the two pairs of interacting proteins.) We generalize our interolog analysis to protein-DNA binding, finding such interactions are conserved at specific thresholds between 30{\%} and 60{\%} sequence identity depending on the protein family. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a "regulog"--a conserved regulatory relationship between proteins across different species. We map interologs and regulogs from yeast to a number of genomes with limited experimental annotation (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana) and make these available through an online database at http://interolog.gersteinlab.org. Specifically, we are able to transfer approximately 90,000 potential protein-protein interactions to the worm. We test a number of these in two-hybrid experiments and are able to verify 45 overlaps, which we show to be statistically significant.},

Such understanding can be leveraged to assess the risk of chemicals, drugs, and consumer products in living organisms. In system toxicology, machine learning techniques and methodologies are applied to develop prediction models for classification of toxicant exposure of biological systems. Gene expression data (RNA/DNA microarray) are often used to develop such prediction models. The outcome of the present work is an experimental methodology to develop prediction models, based on robust gene signatures, for the classification of cigarette smoke exposure and cessation in humans. It is a result of the participation in the recent sbv IMPROVER SysTox Computational Challenge. By merging different gene selection techniques, we obtain robust gene signatures and we investigate prediction capabilities of different off-the-shelf machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks, linear models and support vector machines. We also predict six novel genes in our signature, and firmly believe these genes have to be further investigated as biomarkers for tobacco smoking exposure. The proposed methodology provides gene signatures with top-ranked performances in the prediction of the investigated classification methods, as well as new discoveries in genetic signatures for bio-markers of the smoke exposure of humans.},

abstract = {trans-10, cis-12 Conjugated linoleic acid (t10. c12 CLA) reduces triglyceride levels in adipocytes. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inflammation were recently demonstrated to be involved in the emerging pathways regulating this response. This study further investigated the role of AMPK and inflammation by testing the following hypotheses: (1) a moderate activation of AMPK and an inflammatory response are sufficient to reduce triglycerides, and (2) strong activation of AMPK is also sufficient. Experiments were performed by adding compounds that affect these pathways and by measuring their effects in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A comparison of four AMPK activators (metformin, phenformin, TNF-$\alpha$ and t10. c12 CLA) found a correlation between AMPK activity and triglyceride reduction. This correlation appeared to be modulated by the level of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA produced. Inhibitors of the prostaglandin (PG) biosynthetic pathway interfered with t10. c12 CLA's ability to reduce triglycerides. A combination of metformin and PGH2, or phenformin alone, efficiently reduced triglyceride levels in adipocytes. Microarray analysis indicated that the transcriptional responses to phenformin or t10. c12 CLA were very similar, suggesting similar pathways were activated. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were found to weakly induce the integrated stress response (ISR) in response to phenformin or t10. c12 CLA and to respond robustly as they differentiated into adipocytes. This indicated that both chemicals required adipocytes at the same stage of differentiation to be competent for this response. These results support the above hypotheses and suggest compounds that moderately activate AMPK and increase PG levels or robustly activate AMPK in adipocytes may be beneficial for reducing adiposity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Purpose Our previously reported 29-gene expression signature identified an aggressive subgroup of endometrial cancer patients with PI3K activation. We here wanted to validate these findings by independent patient series. Patients and Methods The 29-gene expression signature was assessed in fresh frozen tumor tissue from 280 primary endometrial carcinomas (three independent cohorts), 19 metastatic lesions and in 333 primary endometrial carcinomas using TCGA data, and expression was related to clinico-pathologic features and survival. The 29-gene signature was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR, DNA oligonucleotide microarrays, or RNA sequencing. PI3K alterations were assessed by immunohistochemistry, DNA microarrays, DNA sequencing, SNP arrays or fluorescence in situ hybridization. A panel of markers of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) was also correlated to the 29-gene signature score. Results High 29-gene Endometrial Carcinoma Recurrence Score (ECARS) values consistently validated to identify patients with aggressive clinico-pathologic phenotype and reduced survival. Within the presumed favorable subgroups of low grade, endometrioid tumors confined to the uterus, high ECARS still predicted a poor prognosis. The score was higher in metastatic compared to primary lesions (P {\textless} 0.001) and was significantly associated with potential measures of PI3K activation, markers of EMT and vascular invasion as an indicator of metastatic spread (all P {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions ECARS validates to identify aggressive endometrial carcinomas in multiple, independent patients cohorts. The higher signature score in metastatic compared to primary lesions, and the potential link to PI3K activation and EMT, support further studies of ECARS in relation to response to PI3K and EMT inhibitors in clinical trials of metastatic endometrial carcinoma.},

abstract = {Among all types of cancer, incidence of lung cancer remains the highest with regard to cancer-related mortality. Problems contributing to recurrence of the disease include metastasis and drug resistance. Mounting evidence has demonstrated involvement of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer progression. EMT is a critical mechanism ensuring tissue remodeling during morphogenesis of multicellular organisms. Therefore, understanding of the biology of this process for identification of potential EMT-targeted therapeutic strategies for the benefit cancer patients is necessary. This review describes recent evidence of EMT involvement in drug resistance and metastasis of cancers, with an emphasis on lung cancer.},

abstract = {High-dimensional data sets generated by high-throughput technologies, such as DNA microarray, are often the outputs of complex networked systems driven by hidden regulatory signals. Traditional statistical methods for computing low-dimensional or hidden representations of these data sets, such as principal component analysis and independent component analysis, ignore the underlying network structures and provide decompositions based purely on a priori statistical constraints on the computed component signals. The resulting decomposition thus provides a phenomenological model for the observed data and does not necessarily contain physically or biologically meaningful signals. Here, we develop a method, called network component analysis, for uncovering hidden regulatory signals from outputs of networked systems, when only a partial knowledge of the underlying network topology is available. The a priori network structure information is first tested for compliance with a set of identifiability criteria. For networks that satisfy the criteria, the signals from the regulatory nodes and their strengths of influence on each output node can be faithfully reconstructed. This method is first validated experimentally by using the absorbance spectra of a network of various hemoglobin species. The method is then applied to microarray data generated from yeast Saccharamyces cerevisiae and the activities of various transcription factors during cell cycle are reconstructed by using recently discovered connectivity information for the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks.},

abstract = {Although numerous studies have shown the significance of cancer-specific aerobic glycolysis, how glycolysis contributes to tumor invasion, a critical phenomenon in metastasis, remains unclear. With regard to colorectal cancer (CRC), we studied two critical gate enzymes, hexokinase 2 (HK2), which is involved in glycolysis, and phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase-E1$\alpha$ (p-PDH), which is involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Immunohistochemical analyses using anti-HK2 and p-PDH antibodies were performed on surgically resected CRC samples (n = 104), and the expression in invasive front lesions of tumors was assessed. Positive HK2 expression correlated with extensive tumor diameter (P = 0.0460), advanced tumor depth (P = 0.0395), and presence of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0409). Expression of p-PDH tended to be higher in right-sided CRCs than in left-sided CRCs (P = 0.0883). In survival analysis, the combined evaluation of positive HK2 and negative p-PDH was associated with reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.0169 in all stages and P = 0.0238 in Stage II and III patients, respectively). This evaluation could predict RFS more precisely than the independent evaluation. The present study indicated that high HK2 expression combined with low p-PDH expression in the invasive front lesions of CRC tumors is predictive of tumor aggressiveness and survival of CRC cases.},

@article{Li2016i,
abstract = {Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) measures genome-wide gene expression. RNA-Seq data is count-based rendering normal distribution models for analysis inappropriate. Normalization of RNA-Seq data to transform the data has limitations which can adversely impact the analysis. Furthermore, there are a few count-based methods for analysis of RNA-Seq data but they are essentially for pairwise analysis of treatment groups or multiclasses but not pattern-based to identify co-expressed genes. Results: We adapted our extracting patterns and identifying genes methodology for RNA-Seq (EPIG-Seq) count data. The software uses count-based correlation to measure similarity between genes, quasi-Poisson modelling to estimate dispersion in the data and a location parameter to indicate magnitude of differential expression. EPIG-Seq is different than any other software currently available for pattern analysis of RNA-Seq data in that EPIG-Seq 1) uses count level data and supports cases of inflated zeros, 2) identifies statistically significant clusters of genes that are co-expressed across experimental conditions, 3) takes into account dispersion in the replicate data and 4) provides reliable results even with small sample sizes. EPIG-Seq operates in two steps: 1) extract the pattern profiles from data as seeds for clustering co-expressed genes and 2) cluster the genes to the pattern seeds and compute statistical significance of the pattern of co-expressed genes. EPIG-Seq provides a table of the genes with bootstrapped p-values and profile plots of the patterns of co-expressed genes. In addition, EPIG-Seq provides a heat map and principal component dimension reduction plot of the clustered genes as visual aids. We demonstrate the utility of EPIG-Seq through the analysis of toxicogenomics and cancer data sets to identify biologically relevant co-expressed genes. EPIG-Seq is available at: sourceforge.net/projects/epig-seq. Conclusions: EPIG-Seq is unlike any other software currently available for pattern analysis of RNA-Seq count level data across experimental groups. Using the EPIG-Seq software to analyze RNA-Seq count data across biological conditions permits the ability to extract biologically meaningful co-expressed genes associated with coordinated regulation.},

Comprehensive pair-wise correlations were calculated between gene expression and measures of agent susceptibility. Associations weaker than a threshold strength were removed, leaving networks of highly correlated genes and agents called relevance networks. Hypotheses for potential single-gene determinants of anticancer agent susceptibility were constructed. The effect of random chance in the large number of calculations performed was empirically determined by repeated random permutation testing; only associations stronger than those seen in multiply permuted data were used in clustering. We discuss the advantages of this methodology over alternative approaches, such as phylogenetic-type tree clustering and self-organizing maps.},

abstract = {Objective To determine the role of miR-378 as a biomarker for anti-angiogenic therapy response in ovarian cancer. Methods Expression of miR-378 was analyzed in ovarian cancer cell lines and human tumors vs. normal ovarian epithelial cells by qRT-PCR. After miR-378 transfection in SKOV3 cells, dysregulated genes were identified using microarray. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was utilized to correlate miR-378 expression with progression-free survival (PFS) among patients treated with anti-angiogenic therapy by using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards. Results MiR-378 was overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and tumors vs. normal ovarian epithelial cells. Overexpressing miR-378 in ovarian cancer cells altered expression of genes associated with angiogenesis (ALCAM, EHD1, ELK3, TLN1), apoptosis (RPN2, HIPK3), and cell cycle regulation (SWAP-70, LSM14A, RDX). In the TCGA dataset, low vs. high miR-378 expression was associated with longer PFS in a subset of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with bevacizumab (9.2 vs. 4.2 months; p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, miR-378 expression was an independent predictor for PFS after anti-angiogenic treatment (HR = 2.04, 95{\%} CI: 1.12-3.72; p = 0.02). Furthermore, expression levels of two miR-378 targets (ALCAM and EHD1) were associated with PFS in this subgroup of patients who received anti-angiogenic therapy (9.4 vs. 4.2 months, p = 0.04 for high vs. low ALCAM; 7.9 vs. 2.3 months, p {\textless} 0.01 for low vs. high EHD1). Conclusions Our data suggest that miR-378 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and tumors vs. normal ovarian epithelial cells. MiR-378 and its downstream targets may serve as markers for response to anti-angiogenic therapy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The forkhead transcription factor Foxo1 is regulated by insulin via Akt-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion. We show that Foxo1 is induced in the early stages of adipocyte differentiation but that its activation is delayed until the end of the clonal expansion phase. Constitutively active Foxo1 prevents the differentiation of preadipocytes, while dominant-negative Foxo1 restores adipocyte differentiation of fibroblasts from insulin receptor-deficient mice. Further, Foxo1 haploinsufficiency protects from diet-induced diabetes in mice. We propose that Foxo1 plays an important role in the integration of hormone-activated signaling pathways with the complex transcriptional cascade that promotes adipocyte differentiation.},

abstract = {Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a post-translational modification of proteins mediated by PARP family members, such as PARP-1. Although PARylation has been studied extensively, few examples of definitive biological roles for site-specific PARylation have been reported. Here we show that C/EBP$\beta$, a key pro-adipogenic transcription factor, is PARylated by PARP-1 on three amino acids in a conserved regulatory domain. PARylation at these sites inhibits C/EBP$\beta$'s DNA binding and transcriptional activities and attenuates adipogenesis in various genetic and cell-based models. Interestingly, PARP-1 catalytic activity drops precipitously during the first 48 hr of differentiation, corresponding to a release of C/EBP$\beta$ from PARylation-mediated inhibition. This promotes the binding of C/EBP$\beta$ at enhancers controlling the expression of adipogenic target genes and continued differentiation. Depletion or chemical inhibition of PARP-1, or mutation of the PARylation sites on C/EBP$\beta$, enhances these early adipogenic events. Collectively, our results provide a clear example of how site-specific PARylation drives biological outcomes.},

abstract = {Fat cell metabolism has an impact on body homeostasis and its proper function. Nevertheless, the knowledge about simultaneous metabolic processes, which occur during adipogenesis and in mature adipocytes, is limited. Identification of key metabolic events associated with fat cell metabolism could be beneficial in the field of novel drug development, drug repurposing, as well as for the discovery of patterns predicting obesity risk. The main objective of our work was to provide comprehensive characterization of metabolic processes occurring during adipogenesis and in mature adipocytes. In order to globally determine crucial metabolic pathways involved in fat cell metabolism, metabolomics and transcriptomics approaches were applied. We observed significantly regulated metabolites correlating with significantly regulated genes at different stages of adipogenesis. We identified the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines, the metabolism of even and odd chain fatty acids, as well as the catabolism of branched chain amino acids (BCAA; leucine, isoleucine and valine) as key regulated pathways. Our further analysis led to identification of an enzymatic switch comprising the enzymes Hmgcs2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase) and Auh (AU RNA binding protein/enoyl-CoA hydratase) which connects leucine degradation with cholesterol synthesis. In addition, propionyl-CoA, a product of isoleucine degradation, was identified as a putative substrate for odd chain fatty acid synthesis. The uncovered crosstalks between BCAA and lipid metabolism during adipogenesis might contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms of obesity and have potential implications in obesity prediction.},

abstract = {Autophagy plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis through the degradation and recycling of organelles such as mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are closely related to the pathogenesis of diabetes. In pancreatic $\beta$-cells producing insulin, autophagy helps maintain $\beta$-cell mass, structure and function. In mice with $\beta$-cell-specific deletion of Atg7 (autophagy-related 7), a critical autophagy gene, reduction of $\beta$-cell mass and pancreatic insulin content were observed together with impaired insulin secretory function. Because of such structural and functional defects, $\beta$-cell-specific Atg7-null mice showed hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. However, those mice never developed diabetes. Obesity and lipids are physiological ER stressors that can precipitate $\beta$-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Recent studies showed that $\beta$-cell-specific Atg7-null mice, when bred with ob/ob mice, developed severe diabetes, suggesting that autophagy-deficient $\beta$-cells can handle basal metabolic stress but have problems dealing with increased metabolic stress. Thus, autophagy deficiency in $\beta$-cells could be a factor in the progression from obesity to diabetes due to an inappropriate response to obesity-induced ER stress. Autophagy also appears to play a role in the hypothalamic control of energy expenditure, appetite and body weight. Thus, autophagy is important to body and nutrient metabolism in many ways, and its dysregulation could contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders and diabetes. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Pharmaceutical Society of Korea.},

RISP-null fetal HSCs displayed impaired respiration resulting in a decreased NAD(+)/NADH ratio. RISP-null fetal HSCs and progenitors exhibited an increase in both DNA and histone methylation associated with increases in 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), a metabolite known to inhibit DNA and histone demethylases. RISP inactivation in adult HSCs also impaired respiration resulting in loss of quiescence concomitant with severe pancytopenia and lethality.

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in drug resistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The aims of this study were to explore the potential role of miR-206 in governing cisplatin resistance and EMT in lung cancer cells. We found that both lung adenocarcinoma A549 cisplatin-resistant cells (A549/DDP) and H1299 cisplatin-resistant cells (H1299/DDP) acquired mesenchymal features and were along with low expression of miR-206 and high migration and invasion abilities. Ectopic expression of miR-206 mimics inhibited cisplatin resistance, reversed the EMT phenotype, decreased the migration and invasion in these DDP-resistant cells. In contrast, miR-206 inhibitors increased cisplatin resistance, EMT, cell migration and invasion in non-DDP-resistant cells. Furthermore, we found that MET is the direct target of miR-206 in lung cancer cells. Knockdown of MET exhibited an EMT and DDP resistant inhibitory effect on DDP-resistant cells. Conversely, overexpression of MET in non-DDP- resistant cells produced a promoting effect on cell EMT and DDP resistance. In lung adenocarcinoma tissues, we demonstrated that low expression of miR-206 were also correlated with increased cisplatin resistance and MET expression. In addition, we revealed that miR-206 overexpression reduced cisplatin resistance and EMT in DDP-resistant cells, partly due to inactivation of MET/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and subsequent downregulation of MDR1, ZEB1 and Snail expression. Finally, we found that miR-206 could also sensitize A549/DDP cells to cisplatin in mice model. Taken together, our study implied that activation of miR-206 or inactivation of its target gene pathway could serve as a novel approach to reverse cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinomas cells.},

Results Two polymorphisms in complete linked disequilibrium with each other were identified, -432C- {\textgreater} T and a "C" insert at position -86. The -432T allele occurs within an octamer containing an ATTT motif resembling members of the POU family of transcription factors. In each population analyzed, an increase in -432T was found in patients. EMSAs showed that a -432T containing oligonucleotide binds to brain proteins that do not recognize -432C.

abstract = {WD-repeat proteins are regulatory beta-propeller platforms that enable the assembly of multiprotein complexes. Here, we report the functional and bioinformatic analysis of human WD-repeat protein Interacting with PhosphoInosides (WIPI)-1alpha (WIPI49/Atg18), a member of a novel WD-repeat protein family with autophagic capacity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, recently identified as phospholipid-binding effectors. Our phylogenetic analysis divides the WIPI protein family into two paralogous groups that fold into 7-bladed beta-propellers. Structural modeling identified two evolutionary conserved interaction sites in WIPI propellers, one of which may bind phospholipids. Human WIPI-1alpha has LXXLL signature motifs for nuclear receptor interactions and binds androgen and estrogen receptors in vitro. Strikingly, human WIPI genes were found aberrantly expressed in a variety of matched tumor tissues including kidney, pancreatic and skin cancer. We found that endogenous hWIPI-1 protein colocalizes in part with the autophagosomal marker LC3 at punctate cytoplasmic structures in human melanoma cells. In addition, hWIPI-1 accumulated in large vesicular and cup-shaped structures in the cytoplasm when autophagy was induced by amino-acid deprivation. These cytoplasmic formations were blocked by wortmannin, a classic inhibitor of PI-3 kinase-mediated autophagy. Our data suggest that WIPI proteins share an evolutionary conserved function in autophagy and that autophagic capacity may be compromised in human cancers.},

abstract = {Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), an endogenous inhibitor of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, suppresses metastasis in a number of cancer types, including colorectal carcinoma (CRC); thus, RKIP downregulation significantly contributes to CRC invasiveness and metastatic potential. However, our previous study demonstrated that RKIP-positive tumors in CRC patients are predictive of hepatic colorectal metastases (HCMs). Based on the previous finding that the ERK pathway can be activated independently of RKIP, we hypothesized that RKIP-expressing HCMs may express significant levels of phosphorylated ERK (pERK). Thus, the present study evaluated the expression of RKIP and pERK in 68 HCM tissue samples using immunohistochemistry. RKIP expression was positive in 22 (32.4{\%}) of the 68 samples, seven (31.8{\%}) of which exhibited nuclear pERK immunoreactivity exclusively at the invasive tumor front. Furthermore, pERK expression at the invasive front was significantly associated with recurrent HCM following hepatic resection, and pERK expression observed at the invasive front of RKIP-expressing HCMs indicated that the activation of the ERK pathway may also be involved in the invasive process of these tumors, despite the presence of RKIP. A strong association between pERK expression and the presence of recurrent HCM may indicate that the ERK pathway is important in the metastatic recurrence of RKIP-positive HCM.},

abstract = {Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) are genetic disorders that affect connective tissue as a result of dysregulated TGF-$\beta$ signaling. MFS is most frequently caused by mutations in FBN1 whereas Loeys-Dietz syndrome results from mutations in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2. There is substantial inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability among these disorders, suggesting the presence of genetic modifiers. Previously, a polymorphism in the TGF$\beta$R1 protein termed the TFGBR1*6A allele was found to be overrepresented in patients with MFS and was identified as a low penetrance allele with suggestion as a possible modifier. To further investigate the importance of this variant, a retrospective review of genetic and phenotypic findings was conducted for 335 patients evaluated for suspicion of MFS or related disorders. In patients with a diagnosis of MFS, the presence of the TFGBR1*6A allele was not associated with phenotypic differences. Similarly, careful phenotyping of patients who carried the TFGBR1*6A allele but did not have MFS did not identify an altered frequency of specific connective tissue features. In this small cohort, the results did not reach significance to identify the TFGBR1*6A allele as a major modifier for aortic dilation, ectopia lentis, or systemic features associated with MFS or other connective tissue disorders. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Glycolysis links to gene transcription via the essential coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in its oxidized state (NAD+).

abstract = {Recent analysis of the structure of transcription regulation networks revealed several "network motifs": regulatory circuit patterns that occur much more frequently than in randomized networks. It is important to understand whether these network motifs have specific functions. One of the most significant network motifs is the coherent feedforward loop, in which transcription factor X regulates transcription factor Y, and both jointly regulate gene Z. On the basis of mathematical modeling and simulations, it was suggested that the coherent feedforward loop could serve as a sign-sensitive delay element: a circuit that responds rapidly to step-like stimuli in one direction (e.g. ON to OFF), and at a delay to steps in the opposite direction (OFF to ON). Is this function actually carried out by feedforward loops in living cells? Here, we address this experimentally, using a system with feedforward loop connectivity, the L-arabinose utilization system of Escherichia coli. We measured responses to step-like cAMP stimuli at high temporal resolution and accuracy by means of green fluorescent protein reporters. We show that the arabinose system displays sign-sensitive delay kinetics. This type of kinetics is important for making decisions based on noisy inputs by filtering out fluctuations in input stimuli, yet allowing rapid response. This information-processing function may be performed by the feedforward loop regulation modules that are found in diverse systems from bacteria to humans.},

abstract = {Cellular senescence is a physiological process of irreversible cell-cycle arrest that contributes to various physiological and pathological processes of aging. Whereas replicative senescence is associated with telomere attrition after repeated cell division, stress-induced premature senescence occurs in response to aberrant oncogenic signaling, oxidative stress, and DNA damage which is independent of telomere dysfunction. Recent evidence indicates that cellular senescence provides a barrier to tumorigenesis and is a determinant of the outcome of cancer treatment. However, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which contributes to multiple facets of senescent cancer cells, may influence both cancer-inhibitory and cancer-promoting mechanisms of neighboring cells. Conventional treatments, such as chemo- and radiotherapies, preferentially induce premature senescence instead of apoptosis in the appropriate cellular context. In addition, treatment-induced premature senescence could compensate for resistance to apoptosis via alternative signaling pathways. Therefore, we believe that an intensive effort to understand cancer cell senescence could facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for improving the efficacy of anticancer therapies. This review summarizes the current understanding of molecular mechanisms, functions, and clinical applications of cellular senescence for anticancer therapy.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Glioblastoma is the most aggressive brain tumor and, even with the current multimodal therapy, is an invariably lethal cancer with a life expectancy that depends on the tumor subtype but, even in the most favorable cases, rarely exceeds 2 years. Epigenetic factors play an important role in gliomagenesis, are strong predictors of outcome, and are important determinants for the resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. The latest addition to the epigenetic machinery is the noncoding RNA (ncRNA), that is, RNA molecules that are not translated into a protein and that exert their function by base pairing with other nucleic acids in a reversible and nonmutational mode. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of ncRNA of about 22 bp that regulate gene expression by binding to complementary sequences in the mRNA and silence its translation into proteins. MicroRNAs reversibly regulate transcription through nonmutational mechanisms; accordingly, they can be considered as epigenetic effectors. In this review, we will discuss the role of miRNA in glioma focusing on their role in drug resistance and on their potential applications in the therapy of this tumor.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Histone modifications and their modifying enzymes are fundamentally involved in the epigenetic regulation of adipogenesis. This study aimed to define the roles of various histone modifications and their "division of labor" in fat cell differentiation. To achieve these goals, we examined the distribution patterns of eight core histone modifications at five key adipogenic regulatory genes, Pref-1, C/EBP$\beta$, C/EBP$\alpha$, PPAR$\gamma$2 and aP2, during the adipogenesis of C3H 10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. We found that the examined histone modifications are globally stable throughout adipogenesis but show distinct and highly dynamic distribution patterns at specific genes. For example, the Pref-1 gene has lower levels of active chromatin markers and significantly higher H3 K27 tri-methylation in MSCs compared with committed preadipocytes; the C/EBP$\beta$ gene is enriched in active chromatin markers at its 3́-UTR; the C/EBP$\alpha$ gene is predominantly marked by H3 K27 tri-methylation in adipogenic precursor cells, and this repressive marker decreases dramatically upon induction; the PPAR$\gamma$2 and aP2 genes show increased histone acetylation on both H3 and H4 tails during adipogenesis. Further functional studies revealed that the decreased level of H3 K27 tri-methylation leads to de-repression of Pref-1 gene, while the increased level of histone acetylation activates the transcription of PPAR$\gamma$2 and aP2 genes. Moreover, the active histone modification-marked 3′-UTR of C/EBP$\beta$ gene was demonstrated as a strong enhancer element by luciferase assay. Our results indicate that histone modifications are gene-specific at adipogenic regulator genes, and they play distinct roles in regulating the transcriptional network during adipogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Landes Bioscience.},

The dialogue between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma is a complex and dynamic phenomenon, as many cell types and soluble factors are involved.While the function of many of the players involved in this cross talk have been studied, the regulatory mechanisms and signaling pathways that control their expression haven't been investigated in depth. By using a novel, interdisciplinary approach applied to the mechanism of action of the metastasis suppressor, Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), we identified a signaling pathway that suppresses invasion and metastasis through regulation of stroma-associated genes. Conceptually, the approach we developed uses a master regulator and expression arrays from breast cancer patients to formulate hypotheses based on clinical data. Experimental validation is followed by further bioinformatic analysis to establish the clinical significance of discoveries. Using RKIP as an example we show here that this multi-step approach can be used to identify gene regulatory mechanisms that affect tumor-stroma interactions that in turn influencemetastasis to the bone or other organs. 1.},

Moreover, post-translational modifications can modify the activity of the coded protein without altering the expression levels of the coding gene, but eliciting variations to the expression levels of the regulated genes. These considerations motivate the study of the rewiring of networks co-expressed genes as a consequence of the aforementioned alterations in order to complement the informative content of differential expression. We analyzed 339 mRNAomes of five distinct cancer types to find single genes that presented co-expression patterns strongly differentiated between normal and tumor phenotypes. Our analysis of differentially connected genes indicates the loss of connectivity as a common topological trait of cancer networks, and unveils novel candidate cancer genes. Moreover, our integrated approach that combines the differential expression together with the differential connectivity improves the classic enrichment pathway analysis providing novel insights on putative cancer gene biosystems not still fully investigated. {\textcopyright} 2014 Anglani et al.},

Although more than 40 distinct TBC domain-containing proteins have been identified in humans, the GAP activity and specificity of most TBC proteins have never been determined. In this study we developed a novel method of screening for Rab3A-GAP and identified two TBC proteins (FLJ13130 and RN-tre) whose expression in PC12 cells was associated with exclusion of endogenous Rab3A molecules from dense-core vesicles. As expression of RN-tre caused fragmentation of the Golgi, which presumably resulted in the loss of dense-core vesicles themselves, we further characterized FLJ13130 as a candidate Rab3A-GAP. The results showed that expression of FLJ13130, but not of its catalytically inactive R134K mutant, greatly reduced the amount of GTP-Rab3A in living cells and promoted the GTPase activity of Rab3A in vitro. Unexpectedly, however, FLJ13130 also promoted the GTPase activity of Rab22A, Rab27A, and Rab35, but not of Rab2A or Rab6A. Based on these results, we propose that FLJ13130 is a novel type of Rab-GAP that exhibits broad GAP specificity and inactivates several distinct Rab isoforms, including Rab3A, just near the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {The three dimensional folding of mammalian genomes is cell type specific and difficult to alter suggesting that it is an important component of gene regulation. However, given the multitude of chromatin-associating factors, the mechanisms driving the colocalization of active chromosomal domains and the role of this organization in regulating the transcription program in adipocytes are not clear. Analysis of genome-wide chromosomal associations revealed cell type-specific spatial clustering of adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 cells. Time course analysis demonstrated that the adipogenic 'hub', sampled by PPAR$\gamma$ and Lpin1, undergoes orchestrated reorganization during adipogenesis. Coupling the dynamics of genome architecture with multiple chromatin datasets indicated that among all the transcription factors (TFs) tested, RXR is central to genome reorganization at the beginning of adipogenesis. Interestingly, at the end of differentiation, the adipogenic hub was shifted to an H3K27me3-repressive environment in conjunction with attenuation of gene transcription. We propose a stage-specific hierarchy for the activity of TFs contributing to the establishment of an adipogenic genome architecture that brings together the adipogenic genetic program. In addition, the repositioning of this network in a H3K27me3-rich environment at the end of differentiation may contribute to the stabilization of gene transcription levels and reduce the developmental plasticity of these specialized cells.

In this review we discuss recent advances in our understanding of TFs as drug targets in oncology, with an emphasis on the emerging chemical approaches to modulate TF function.

abstract = {Using an ornithine-$\delta$-aminotransferase (OAT) cDNA, we identified five YACs that cover two nonadjacent OAT-related loci in Xp11.2-p11.3, designated OATL1 (distal) and OATL2 (proximal). Because several retinal degenerative disorders map to this region, we used YAC2 (480 kb), which covers the most distal part of OATL1, as a probe to screen a retinal cDNA library. From 8 × 104plaques screened, we isolated 13 clones. Two were OAT cDNAs. The remaining 11 were divided into eight groups by cross-hybridization. Groups 1-4 contain cDNAs that originate from single-copy X-linked genes in YAC2. Each has an open reading frame of {\textgreater}500 bp and detects one or more transcripts on a Northern blot. The gene for each was sublocalized and ordered in YAC2. The cDNAs in groups 5-8 contained two or more Alu sequences, had no open reading frames, and did not detect transcripts. The cDNAs from groups 1-4 provide expressed sequence tags and identify candidate genes for the genetic disorders that map to this region. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Direct lineage reprogramming is a promising approach for human disease modeling and regenerative medicine, with poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we reveal a hierarchical mechanism in the direct conversion of fibroblasts into induced neuronal (iN) cells mediated by the transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l. Ascl1 acts as an "on-target" pioneer factor by immediately occupying most cognate genomic sites in fibroblasts. In contrast, Brn2 and Myt1l do not access fibroblast chromatin productively on their own; instead, Ascl1 recruits Brn2 to Ascl1 sites genome wide. A unique trivalent chromatin signature in the host cells predicts the permissiveness for Ascl1 pioneering activity among different cell types. Finally, we identified Zfp238 as a key Ascl1 target gene that can partially substitute for Ascl1 during iN cell reprogramming. Thus, a precise match between pioneer factors and the chromatin context at key target genes is determinative for transdifferentiation to neurons and likely other cell types. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {RhoB has been implicated in cell growth control, actin regulation, adhesion-dependent viability, and gene expression, but its effector functions are poorly defined. Prenylation is important for the physiological functions of Rho proteins, so to identify RhoB effector functions we identified proteins whose interaction was sensitive to prenylation. Here we report the investigation of one such protein, an ubiquitously expressed transcription factor termed DB1 that was originally cloned as a Tax-activated regulator of the IL3 promoter. The RhoB-binding domain in DB1 was located in a functionally undefined region upstream and separable from its zinc finger DNA binding domain. DB1 interacted strongly with prenylated RhoB but weakly with RhoA and not at all with H-Ras. Functional interaction was supported by the identification of prenylated species of RhoB in the nuclear membrane and in an intranuclear laminar region, where they were available for DB1 association in principle, and by the ability of RhoB to inhibit transcriptional activation by DB1, whereas RhoA or Ras had little or no effect, respectively. The results of this study suggest a novel mechanism by which certain Rho proteins may regulate transcription, through sequestration of a transcription factor.},

Alterations in macroautophagy, the main process responsible for bulk autophagic degradation, have been proposed to contribute to pathogenesis in Huntington's disease (HD), a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. However, the precise mechanism behind macroautophagy malfunction in HD is poorly understood. In this work, using cellular and mouse models of HD and cells from humans with HD, we have identified a primary defect in the ability of autophagic vacuoles to recognize cytosolic cargo in HD cells. Autophagic vacuoles form at normal or even enhanced rates in HD cells and are adequately eliminated by lysosomes, but they fail to efficiently trap cytosolic cargo in their lumen. We propose that inefficient engulfment of cytosolic components by autophagosomes is responsible for their slower turnover, functional decay and accumulation inside HD cells.},

abstract = {Promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing is implicated in the regulation of gene transcription. However, the mechanisms of pausing including its dynamics during transcriptional responses remain to be fully understood. We performed global analysis of short capped RNAs and Pol II Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing in MCF-7 breast cancer cells to map Pol II pausing across the genome, and used permanganate footprinting to specifically follow pausing during transcriptional activation of several genes involved in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We find that the gene for EMT master regulator Snail (SNAI1), but not Slug (SNAI2), shows evidence of Pol II pausing before activation. Transcriptional activation of the paused SNAI1 gene is accompanied by a further increase in Pol II pausing signal, whereas activation of non-paused SNAI2 gene results in the acquisition of a typical pausing signature. The increase in pausing signal reflects increased transcription initiation without changes in Pol II pausing. Activation of the heat shock HSP70 gene involves pausing release that speeds up Pol II turnover, but does not change pausing location. We suggest that Pol II pausing is retained during transcriptional activation and can further undergo regulated release in a signal-specific manner.},

By modeling the genesis of genomic rearrangements, we identified abundant DNA translocations and deletions that arise in a highly interdependent manner. This phenomenon, which we term "chromoplexy," frequently accounts for the dysregulation of prostate cancer genes and appears to disrupt multiple cancer genes coordinately. Our modeling suggests that chromoplexy may induce considerable genomic derangement over relatively few events in prostate cancer and other neoplasms, supporting a model of punctuated cancer evolution. By characterizing the clonal hierarchy of genomic lesions in prostate tumors, we charted a path of oncogenic events along which chromoplexy may drive prostate carcinogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A switching mechanism in gene expression, where two genes are positively correlated in one condition and negatively correlated in the other condition, is a key to elucidating complex biological systems. There already exist methods for detecting switching mechanisms from microarrays. However, current approaches have problems under three real cases: outliers, expression values with a very small range and a small number of examples. ROS-DET overcomes these three problems, keeping the computational complexity of current approaches. We demonstrated that ROS-DET outperformed existing methods, under that all these three situations are considered. Furthermore, for each of the top 10 pairs ranked by ROS-DET, we attempted to identify a pathway, i.e. consecutive biological phenomena, being related with the corresponding two genes by checking the biological literature. In 8 out of the 10 pairs, we found two parallel pathways, one of the two genes being in each of the two pathways and two pathways coming to (or starting with) the same gene. This indicates that two parallel pathways would be cooperatively used under one experimental condition, corresponding to the positive correlation, and the two pathways might be alternatively used under the other condition, corresponding to the negative correlation.

While the acute regulation of lipolysis has been studied in detail, the transcriptional determinants of WAT lipolytic activity remain still largely unexplored. Here we show that the genetic inactivation of transcriptional cofactor transducin beta-like-related 1(TBLR1) blunts the lipolytic response of white adipocytes through the impairment of cAMP-dependent signal transduction. Indeed, mice lacking TBLR1 in adipocytes are defective in fasting-induced lipid mobilization and, when placed on a high-fat-diet, show aggravated adiposity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. TBLR1 levels are found to increase under lipolytic conditions in WAT of both human patients and mice, correlating with serum free fatty acids (FFAs). As a critical regulator of WAT cAMP signaling and lipid mobilization, proper activity of TBLR1 in adipocytes might thus represent a critical molecular checkpoint for the prevention of metabolic dysfunction in subjects with obesity-related disorders. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

RKIP loss in the tumor body was marginally associated with advanced T-stage (p=0.0599) as well as high-grade peritumoral (p=0.0048) and intratumoral budding (p=0.0373). RKIP loss in the buds showed a clear association with advanced T stage (p=0.0089).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The progressive loss of RKIP seems to play a major role in the neoplastic transformation of pancreas, correlates with aggressive features in PDAC and is associated with the presence of EMT in form of tumor budding.},

abstract = {Cell-type specific gene expression is regulated by the combinatorial action of transcription factors (TFs). In this study, we predict transcription factor (TF) combinations that cooperatively bind in a cell-type specific manner. We first divide DNase hypersensitive sites into cell-type specifically open vs. ubiquitously open sites in 64 cell types to describe possible cell-type specific enhancers. Based on the pattern contrast between these two groups of sequences we develop “co-occurring TF predictor on Cell-Type specific Enhancers” (coTRaCTE) - a novel statistical method to determine regulatory TF co-occurrences. Contrasting the co-binding of TF pairs between cell-type specific and ubiquitously open chromatin guarantees the high cell-type specificity of the predictions. coTRaCTE predicts more than 2000 co-occurring TF pairs in 64 cell types. The large majority (70{\%}) of these TF pairs is highly cell-type specific and overlaps in TF pair co-occurrence are highly consistent among related cell types. Furthermore, independently validated co-occurring and directly interacting TFs are significantly enriched in our predictions. Focusing on the regulatory network derived from the predicted co-occurring TF pairs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) we find that it consists of three subnetworks with distinct functions: maintenance of pluripotency governed by OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG, regulation of early development governed by KLF4, STAT3, ZIC3 and ZNF148 and general functions governed by MYC, TCF3 and YY1. In summary, coTRaCTE predicts highly cell-type specific co-occurring TFs which reveal new insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.},

This approach uses DHS-Seq data to identify the co-binding of paris of transcription factors. First, the open chromatine sites are identified and divid by spcificity into cell spcific or ubiquitous.

abstract = {Retromer is an endosomal multi-protein complex that organizes the endocytic recycling of a vast range of integral membrane proteins. Here, we establish an additional retromer function in controlling the activity and localization of the late endosomal small GTPase RAB7. Surprisingly, we found that RAB7 not only decorates late endosomes or lysosomes, but is also present on the endoplas-mic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, and mitochondrial membranes, a localization that is maintained by retromer and the retromer-associated RAB7-specific GAP TBC1D5. In the absence of either TBC1D5 or retromer, RAB7 activity state and localization are no longer controlled and hyperactivated RAB7 expands over the entire lysosomal domain. This lysosomal accumulation of hyperactivated RAB7 results in a striking loss of RAB7 mobility and overall deple-tion of the inactive RAB7 pool on endomembranes. Functionally, we establish that this control of RAB7 activity is not required for the recycling of retromer-dependent cargoes, but instead enables the correct sorting of the autophagy related transmembrane protein ATG9a and autophagosome formation around damaged mitochon-dria during Parkin-mediated mitophagy.},

abstract = {Cardiac diseases including hypertrophic and ischemic cardiomyopathies are increasingly being reported to accumulate misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. These findings have led to an increasing interest in protein degradation pathways, like autophagy, which are essential not only for normal protein turnover but also in the removal of misfolded and damaged proteins. Emerging evidence suggests a previously unprecedented role for autophagic processes in cardiac physiology and pathology. This review focuses on the major types of autophagic processes, the genes and protein complexes involved, and their regulation. It discusses the key similarities and differences between macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and selective mitophagy structures and functions. The genetic models available to study loss and gain of macroautophagy, mitophagy, and CMA are discussed. It defines the markers of autophagic processes, methods for measuring autophagic activities, and their interpretations. This review then summarizes the major studies of autophagy in the heart and their contribution to cardiac pathology. Some reports suggest macroautophagy imparts cardioprotection from heart failure pathology. Meanwhile, other studies find macroautophagy activation may be detrimental in cardiac pathology. An improved understanding of autophagic processes and their regulation may lead to a new genre of treatments for cardiac diseases.},

Enriched heatmap is a specific form of heatmap that visualizes how genomic signals are enriched over specific target regions. It is commonly used and efficient at revealing enrichment patterns especially for high dimensional genomic and epigenomic datasets. We present a new R package named EnrichedHeatmap that efficiently visualizes genomic signal enrichment. It provides advanced solutions for normalizing genomic signals within target regions as well as offering highly customizable visualizations. The major advantage of EnrichedHeatmap is the ability to conveniently generate parallel heatmaps as well as complex annotations, which makes it easy to integrate and visualize comprehensive overviews of the patterns and associations within and between complex datasets. EnrichedHeatmap facilitates comprehensive understanding of high dimensional genomic and epigenomic data. The power of EnrichedHeatmap is demonstrated by visualization of the complex associations between DNA methylation, gene expression and various histone modifications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A major obstacle in treating colorectal cancer (CRC) is the acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. An important protein in the regulation of cancer cell death and clinical outcome is Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP). In contrast, activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a protein that promotes tumor cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis and has an important role in cancer progression in many of cancer types. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulation of RKIP and STAT3 after treatment with clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents (camptothecin (CPT) and oxaliplatin (OXP)) and the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in HCT116 colon cancer cells as well as evaluate the association between RKIP and STAT3 with clinical outcome of Stage II colon cancer patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: HCT-116 colon cancer cells were treated with CPT, OXP, and IL-6 separately or in combination in a time and dose-dependent manner and examined for phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated RKIP and STAT3 via Western blot analysis. STAT3 transcriptional activity was measured via a luciferase reporter assay in HCT116 cells treated with CPT, IL-6 or transfected with JAK 1, 2 separately or in combination. We extended these observations and determined STAT3 and RKIP/ pRKIP in tumor microarrays (TMA) in stage II colon cancer patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We demonstrate IL-6-mediated activation of STAT3 occurs in conjunction with the phosphorylation of RKIP in vitro in human colon cancer cells. OXP and CPT block IL-6 mediated STAT3 activation and RKIP phosphorylation via the inhibition of the interaction of STAT3 with gp130. We determined that STAT3 and nuclear pRKIP are significantly associated with poor patient prognosis in stage II colon cancer patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In the analysis of tumor samples from stage II colon cancer patients and the human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116, pRKIP and STAT3, 2 proteins potentially involved in the resistance to conventional treatments were detected. The phosphorylation of pRKIP and STAT3 are induced by the cytokine IL-6 and suppressed by the chemotherapeutic drugs CPT and OXP. Therefore, these results suggest that STAT3 and pRKIP may serve as prognostic biomarkers in stage II colon cancer patients and may improve chemotherapy.},

Within colorectal adenocarcinomas, a significant increase of MACC1 from tumor center to front (p = 0.0012) was detected. MACC1 was highly overexpressed in 55{\%} tumor budding cells. Independent of geographic location, MACC1 predicted advanced pT and pN-stages, high grade tumor budding, venous and lymphatic invasion (p {\textless} 0.05). High MACC1 expression at the invasive front was decisive for prediction of metastasis (p = 0.0223) and poor survival (p = 0.0217). The geographic pattern of MACC1 did not correlate with MMR-status, BRAF/KRAS-mutations or CpG-island methylation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: MACC1 is differentially expressed in CRC.

abstract = {In normal physiology, autophagy is recognized as a protective housekeeping mechanism that enables elimination of unhealthy organelles, protein aggregates, and invading pathogens, as well as recycling cell components and producing new building blocks and energy for cellular renovation and homeostasis. However, overactive or depressed autophagy is often associated with the pathogenesis of multiple disorders, including cardiac disease. During metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity, dysregulation of autophagy frequently leads to cell death, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac dysfunction. In this article, we summarize the current understanding of autophagy—its classification, progression, and regulation; its roles in both physiological and pathophysiological conditions; and the balance between autophagy and apoptosis. We also explore how dysregulation of autophagy leads to cell death in models of metabolic disease and its contributing factors—including nutrient state, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, insulin inefficiency, and oxidative stress—and outline some recent efforts to restore normal autophagy in pathophysiological states. This information could provide potential targets for the prevention of, or intervention in, cardiac failure in metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity.},

abstract = {PTEN loss and constitutive activation of the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway are key drivers of endometrial tumorigenesis. In some cancer types, PTEN-deficient tumors are reliant on class I PI3K p110beta (encoded by PIK3CB) activity but little is known about this contribution in endometrial tumorigenesis. In this study, we find that p110beta is overexpressed in a panel of 7 endometrial cancer cell lines compared to non-transformed cells. Furthermore, in 234 clinically annotated patient samples, PIK3CB mRNA levels increase significantly in the early phase of tumorigenesis from precursors to low grade primary malignant lesions whereas PIK3CA levels are higher in non-endometrioid compared to endometrioid primary tumors. While high levels of either PIK3CA or PIK3CB associate with poor prognosis, only elevated PIK3CB mRNA levels correlate with a high cell cycle signature score in clinical samples. In cancer cell lines, p110alpha inhibition reduces cell viability by inducing cell death in PIK3CA mutant cells while p110beta inhibition delayed proliferation in PTEN-deficient cells, but not in WT cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that PIK3CB/p110beta contributes to some of the pleiotropic functions of PI3K in endometrial cancer, particularly in the early steps by contributing to cell proliferation.},

abstract = {The most detailed information presently available for an organism's transcriptional regulation network is that for the prokaryote Escherichia coli. In order to gain insight into the evolution of the E.coli regulatory network, we analysed information obtainable for the domains and protein families of the transcription factors and regulated genes. About three-quarters of the 271 transcription factors we identified are two-domain proteins, consisting of a DNA-binding domain along with a regulatory domain. The regulatory domains mainly bind small molecules. Many groups of transcription factors have identical domain architectures, and this implies that roughly three-quarters of the transcription factors have arisen as a consequence of gene duplication. In contrast, there is little evidence of duplication of regulatory regions together with regulated genes or of transcription factors together with regulated genes. Thirty-eight, out of the 121 transcription factors for which one or more regulated genes are known, regulate other transcription factors. This amplification effect, as well as large differences between the numbers of genes directly regulated by transcription factors, means that there are about 10 global regulators which each control many more genes than the other transcription factors.},

abstract = {Background: Traditional methods of analysing gene expression data often include a statistical test to find differentially expressed genes, or use of a clustering algorithm to find groups of genes that behave similarly across a dataset. However, these methods may miss groups of genes which form differential co-expression patterns under different subsets of experimental conditions. Here we describe coXpress, an R package that allows researchers to identify groups of genes that are differentially co-expressed. Results: We have developed coXpress as a means of identifying groups of genes that are differentially co-expressed. The utility of coXpress is demonstrated using two publicly available microarray datasets. Our software identifies several groups of genes that are highly correlated under one set of biologically related experiments, but which show little or no correlation in a second set of experiments. The software uses a re-sampling method to calculate a p-value for each group, and provides several methods for the visualisation of differentially co-expressed genes. Conclusion: CoXpress can be used to find groups of genes that display differential co-expression patterns in microarray datasets. {\textcopyright} 2006 Watson; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Aberrant miRNA expression abnormally modulates gene expression in cells and can contribute to tumorigenesis in humans. This study identified functionally relevant differentially expressed genes using the transcription factors and miRNA-co-regulated network analysis for gastric cancer. The TF-miRNA co-regulatory network was constructed based on data obtained from cDNA microarray and miRNA expression profiling of gastric cancer tissues. The network along with their co-regulated genes was analyzed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED). We found eighteen (17 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes that were co-regulated by transcription factors and miRNAs. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these genes were part of the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and focal adhesion signaling pathways. In addition, qRT- PCR and Western blot data showed an increase in COL1A1 and decrease in NCAM1 mRNA and protein levels in gastric cancer tissues. Thus, these data provided the first evidence to illustrate that altered gene network was associated with gastric cancer invasion. Further study with a large sample size and more functional experiments is needed to confirm these data and contribute to diagnostic and treatment strategies for gastric cancer.},

abstract = {SPINT2 is a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits proteases implicated in cancer progression, like HGFA, hepsin and matriptase. Loss of SPINT2 expression in tumors has been associated with gene promoter hypermethylation; however, little is known about the mechanisms of SPINT2 deregulation in prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to analyze SPINT2 expression levels and understand the possible regulation by SPINT2 promoter hypermethylation in PCa. In a cohort of 57 cases including non-neoplastic and PCa tissues, SPINT2 expression and promoter methylation was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and methylation-specific PCR, respectively. Methylation status of the SPINT2 promoter was also evaluated by bisulfite sequencing and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. Oncomine and TCGA databases were used to perform in silico PCa analysis of SPINT2 mRNA and methylation levels. A reduction in SPINT2 expression levels from non-neoplastic to PCa tissues was observed; however, none of the cases exhibited SPINT2 promoter methylation. Both bisulfite sequencing and 5-aza demonstrated that SPINT2 promoter is not methylated in PCa cells. Bioinformatics approaches did not show downregulation of SPINT2 at the mRNA level and, in corroboration with our results, SPINT2 promoter region is reported to be unmethylated. Our study suggests an involvement of SPINT2 in PCa tumorigenesis, probably in association with a post-translational regulation of SPINT2.},

Studies show the efficacy of orlistat 60 mg for promoting weight and body fat loss in civilians; however, its efficacy among predominantly young, male soldiers is unknown. This study's objective was to examine the effect of a 6-month, standard education-based weight-management program with and without orlistat 60 mg on changes in weight and body fat in overweight soldiers. Data were collected for this randomized, controlled trial from March 2008 to November 2010 at Fort Bragg, NC. Participants were enrolled in an education-based weight management program (n=435; 75{\%} men) and were randomized to placebo or orlistat 60 mg, three capsules daily with meals. All participants were recommended to maintain a reduced-energy, low-fat diet. Among study completers (14{\%} retention rate; placebo n=22, orlistat n=35) members of both groups lost significant weight from baseline (placebo -3.0??5.2 kg; orlistat -3.2??4.7 kg; P{\textless}0.01), but only the orlistat group lost fat mass (-2.5??3.9 kg; P{\textless}0.001), whereas the placebo group lost lean mass (-1.4??2.7 kg; P {\textless}0.01). An intent-to-treat analysis (???1 follow-up body weight measure) demonstrated that the orlistat group lost more fat mass vs the placebo group (-1.3??2.9 kg vs -0.6??1.8 kg, respectively; P{\textless}0.05), but less lean mass (-0.2??2.0 kg vs -0.8??1.8 kg, respectively; P{\textless}0.01).

No significant improvement has been made in last thirty years over the standard treatment with radiotherapy. To address the paucity of understanding of DIPGs, we have carried out integrated molecular profiling of a large series of samples obtained with stereotactic biopsy at diagnosis. While chromosomal imbalances did not distinguish DIPG and supratentorial tumors on CGHarrays, gene expression profiling revealed clear differences between them, with brainstem gliomas resembling midline/thalamic tumours, indicating a closely-related origin. Two distinct subgroups of DIPG were identified. The first subgroup displayed mesenchymal and pro-angiogenic characteristics, with stem cell markers enrichment consistent with the possibility to grow tumor stem cells from these biopsies. The other subgroup displayed oligodendroglial features, and appeared largely driven by PDGFRA, in particular through amplification and/or novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain. Patients in this later group had a significantly worse outcome with an hazard ratio for early deaths, ie before 10 months, 8 fold greater that the ones in the other subgroup (p = 0.041, Cox regression model). The worse outcome of patients with the oligodendroglial type of tumors was confirmed on a series of 55 paraffin-embedded biopsy samples at diagnosis (median OS of 7.73 versus 12.37 months, p = 0.045, log-rank test). Two distinct transcriptional subclasses of DIPG with specific genomic alterations can be defined at diagnosis by oligodendroglial differentiation or mesenchymal transition, respectively. Classifying these tumors by signal transduction pathway activation and by mutation in pathway member genes may be particularily valuable for the development of targeted therapies.},

abstract = {Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is required for adipocyte differentiation, but its role in mature adipocytes is less clear. Here, we report that knockdown of PPARgamma expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes returned the expression of most adipocyte genes to preadipocyte levels. Consistently, down-regulated but not up-regulated genes showed strong enrichment of PPARgamma binding. Surprisingly, not all adipocyte genes were reversed, and the adipocyte morphology was maintained for an extended period after PPARgamma depletion. To explain this, we focused on transcriptional regulators whose adipogenic regulation was not reversed upon PPARgamma depletion. We identified GATA2, a transcription factor whose down-regulation early in adipogenesis is required for preadipocyte differentiation and whose levels remain low after PPARgamma knockdown. Forced expression of GATA2 in mature adipocytes complemented PPARgamma depletion and impaired adipocyte functionality with a more preadipocyte-like gene expression profile. Ectopic expression of GATA2 in adipose tissue in vivo had a similar effect on adipogenic gene expression. These results suggest that PPARgamma-independent down-regulation of GATA2 prevents reversion of mature adipocytes after PPARgamma depletion.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In model organisms such as yeast, large databases of protein-protein  and protein-DNA interactions have become an extremely important resource for the study of protein function, evolution, and gene regulatory dynamics. In this paper we demonstrate that by integrating these interactions with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible to generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms governing the observed changes in gene expression. To perform this integration systematically and at large scale, we introduce an approach for screening a molecular interaction network to identify active subnetworks, i.e., connected regions of the network that show significant changes in expression over particular subsets of conditions. The method we present here combines a rigorous statistical measure for scoring subnetworks with a search algorithm for identifying subnetworks with high score. RESULTS: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362 interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public databases. In the case of the small network, we identified five significant subnetworks that covered 41 out of 77 (53{\%}) of all significant changes in expression. Both network analyses returned several top-scoring subnetworks with good correspondence to known regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These results demonstrate how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to uncover signalling and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative fashion.},

abstract = {Malignant gliomas are highly infiltrative and invasive tumors, which precludes the few treatment options available. Therefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying gliomas aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. The Raf Kinase Inhibitory protein (RKIP), besides regulating important intracellular signaling cascades, was described to be associated with progression, metastasis and prognosis in several human neoplasms. Its role in the prognosis and tumourigenesis of gliomas remains unclear. In the present study, we found that RKIP protein is absent in a low frequency (10{\%}, 20/193) of glioma tumors. Nevertheless, the absence of RKIP expression was an independent prognostic marker in glioma. Additionally, by in vitro downregulation of RKIP, we found that RKIP inhibition induces a higher viability and migration of the cells, having no effect on cellular proliferation and angiogenesis, as assessed by in vivo CAM assay. In conclusion, this is the largest series studied so far evaluating the expression levels of this important cancer suppressor protein in glioma tumors. Our results suggest that in a subset of tumors, the absence of RKIP associates with highly malignant behavior and poor survival of patients, which may be a useful biomarker for tailored treatment of glioma patients.},

Using a nuclear run-on protocol called GRO-cap, which captures TSSs for both stable and unstable transcripts, we conduct detailed comparisons of thousands of promoters and enhancers in human cells. These analyses identify a common architecture of initiation, including tightly spaced (110 bp apart) divergent initiation, similar frequencies of core promoter sequence elements, highly positioned flanking nucleosomes and two modes of transcription factor binding. Post-initiation transcript stability provides a more fundamental distinction between promoters and enhancers than patterns of histone modification and association of transcription factors or co-activators. These results support a unified model of transcription initiation at promoters and enhancers.},

abstract = {Diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder triggered by the deficient secretion of insulin by the pancreatic $\beta$-cell or the resistance of peripheral tissues to the action of the hormone. Chronic hyperglycemia is the major consequence of this failure, and also the main cause of diabetic problems. Indeed, several clinical trials have agreed in that tight glycemic control is the best way to stop progression of the disease. Many anti-diabetic drugs for treatment of type 2 diabetes are commercially available, but no ideal normoglycemic agent has been developed yet. Moreover, weight gain is the most common side effect of many oral anti-diabetic agents and insulin, and increased weight has been shown to worsen glycemic control and increase the risk of diabetes progression. In this sense, the inorganic salt sodium tungstate (NaW) has been studied in different animal models of metabolic syndrome and diabetes, proving to have a potent effect on normalizing blood glucose levels and reducing body weight, without any hypoglycemic action. Although the liver has been studied as the main site of NaW action, positive effects have been also addressed in muscle, pancreas, brain, adipose tissue and intestine, explaining the effective anti-diabetic action of this salt. Here, we review NaW research to date in these different target organs. We believe that NaW deserves more attention, since all available anti-diabetic treatments remain suboptimal and new therapeutics are urgently needed.},

The code specifies the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that underlie all major developmental events. Models of GRNs are required for analysis, for experimental manipulation and, most fundamentally, for comprehension of how GRNs work. To model GRNs requires knowledge of both their overall structure, which depends upon linkage amongst regulatory genes, and the modular building blocks of which GRNs are heirarchically constructed. The building blocks consist of basic transcriptional control processes executed by one or a few functionally linked genes. We show how the functions of several such building blocks can be considered in mathematical terms, and discuss resolution of GRNs by both "top down" and "bottom up" approaches.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Obesity and metabolic syndrome are important public concerns, and there is increasing demand for effective therapeutic strategies. Flavonoids are expected to improve the risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. Anthocyanidins are a kind of flavonoids; well known for their anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties. However, their effects on adipocytes and molecular systems are not well defined. In this study, we examined the effects of anthocyanidins-enriched bilberry extracts on adipocyte differentiation. METHODS Utilizing 3T3-L1 cell line, we investigated that bilberry extracts and anthocyanidins induced inhibition of lipid accumulation during adipogenesis. To identify what is the most important bilberry mediated-effect, we analyzed the expressions of key transcriptional factors associated with adipocyte differentiation by Real Time (RT)-PCR. From the results of RT-PCR, we hypothesized that bilberry extracts and anthocyanidins blocks insulin signal, we determined the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein by western blotting analysis. In addition, we compared the whole-genome expression profiles of early stage of adipocyte differentiation under four different growth conditions (DMSO, bilberry, two anthocyanidins) by microarray analyses and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). RESULTS Exposure to bilberry extracts and anthocyanidins during adipocyte differentiation inhibited 3T3-L1 differentiation. During this period, bilberry extracts and anthocyanidin significantly decreased a key adipocyte differentiation-associated marker, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- $\gamma$ (Ppar $\gamma$ ) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (Srebp1c). Western blotting analysis showed that bilberry extracts and anthocyanidin decreased the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of IRS1. In addition, microarray experiments and GSEA data revealed significantly altered expression of the known genes of the insulin pathway in cells treated with bilberry extracts or anthocyanidins in the early differentiation stages. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate that anthocyanidin enriched bilberry extracts strongly inhibit the adipocyte differentiation via the insulin pathway. Furthermore, bilberry extracts might be used as a potential complementary treatment for the obese patients with metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {Autophagosome formation is a complex process that begins with the nucleation of a pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) that expands into a phagophore or isolation membrane, the precursor of the autophagosome. A key event in the formation of the phagophore is the production of PtdIns3P by the phosphatidylinsitol kinase Vps34. In yeast the two closely related proteins, Atg18 and Atg21, are the only known effectors of PtdIns3P that act in the autophagy pathway. The recruitment of Atg18 or Atg21 to the PAS is an essential step in the formation of the phagophore. Our bioinformatic analysis of the Atg18 and Atg21 orthologues in all eukaryotes shows that WIPI1 and WIPI2 are both mammalian orthologues of Atg18. We show that WIPI2 is a mammalian effector of PtdIns3P and is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cell lines. WIPI2 is recruited to early autophagosomal structures along with Atg16L and ULK1 and is required for the formation of LC3-positive autophagosomes. Furthermore, when WIPI2 is depleted, we observe a remarkable accumulation of omegasomes, ER-localized PtdIns3P-containing structures labeled by DFCP1 (double FYVE domain-containing protein 1), which are thought to act as platforms for autophagosome formation. In view of our data we propose a role for WIPI2 in the progression of omegasomes into autophagosomes.},

abstract = {Cancer cachexia is associated with pronounced adipose tissue loss due to, at least in part, increased fat cell lipolysis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been implicated in controlling several aspects of adipocyte function. To gain insight into the possible impact of miRNAs on adipose lipolysis in cancer cachexia, global miRNA expression was explored in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue from gastrointestinal cancer patients with (n = 10) or without (n = 11) cachexia. Effects of miRNA overexpression or inhibition on lipolysis were determined in human in vitro differentiated adipocytes. Out of 116 miRNAs present in adipose tissue, five displayed distinct cachexia-associated expression according to both microarray and RT-qPCR. Four (miR-483-5p/-23a/-744/-99b) were downregulated, whereas one (miR-378) was significantly upregulated in cachexia. Adipose expression of miR-378 associated strongly and positively with catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes. This correlation is most probably causal because overexpression of miR-378 in human adipocytes increased catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis. In addition, inhibition of miR-378 expression attenuated stimulated lipolysis and reduced the expression of LIPE, PLIN1, and PNPLA2, a set of genes encoding key lipolytic regulators. Taken together, increased miR-378 expression could play an etiological role in cancer cachexia-associated adipose tissue loss via effects on adipocyte lipolysis.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Advances in molecular biological, analytical and computational technologies are enabling us to systematically investigate the complex molecular processes underlying biological systems. In particular, using high-throughput gene expression assays, we are able to measure the output of the gene regulatory network. We aim here to review datamining and modeling approaches for conceptualizing and unraveling the functional relationships implicit in these datasets. Clustering of co-expression profiles allows us to infer shared regulatory inputs and functional pathways. We discuss various aspects of clustering, ranging from distance measures to clustering algorithms and multiple-cluster memberships. More advanced analysis aims to infer causal connections between genes directly, i.e. who is regulating whom and how. We discuss several approaches to the problem of reverse engineering of genetic networks, from discrete Boolean networks, to continuous linear and non-linear models. We conclude that the combination of predictive modeling with systematic experimental verification will be required to gain a deeper insight into living organisms, therapeutic targeting and bioengineering.},

abstract = {In this series of projects of sequencing human cDNA clones which correspond to relatively long and nearly full-length transcripts, we newly determined the sequences of 80 clones, and predicted the coding sequences of the corresponding genes, named KIAA0201 to KIAA0280. Among the sequenced clones, 68 were obtained from human immature myeloid cell line KG-1 and 12 from human brain. The average size of the clones was 5.3 kb, and that of distinct ORFs in clones was 2.8 kb, corresponding to a protein of approximately 100 kDa. Computer search against the public databases indicated that the sequences of 22 genes were unrelated to any reported genes, while the remaining 58 genes carried sequences which show some similarities to known genes. Protein motifs that matched those in the PROSITE motif database were found in 25 genes and significant transmembrane domains were identified in 30 genes. Among the known genes to which significant similarity was shown, the genes that play key roles in regulation of developmental stages, apoptosis and cell-to-cell interaction were included. Taking into account of both the search data on sequence similarity and protein motifs, at least seven genes were considered to be related to transcriptional regulation and six genes to signal transduction. When the expression profiles of the cDNA clones were examined with different human tissues, about half of the clones from brain (5 of 11) showed significant tissue-specificity, while approximately 80{\%} of the genes from KG-1 were expressed ubiquitously.},

abstract = {Multidrug resistance and tumor migration and invasion are the major obstacles to effective breast cancer chemotherapy, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the potential of transgelin 2 and salvianolic acid A to modulate the resistance and the migration and invasion abilities of paclitaxel-resistant human breast cancer cells (MCF-7/PTX). MCF-7/PTX cells were found to exhibit not only a high degree of resistance to paclitaxel, but also strong migration and invasion abilities. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TAGLN2 sensitized the MCF-7/PTX cells to paclitaxel, and inhibited their migration and invasion abilities. In addition, we also observed that combined salvianolic acid A and paclitaxel treatment could reverse paclitaxel resistance, markedly inhibit tumor migration and invasion, and suppress the expression of transgelin 2 in MCF-7/PTX cells. These findings indicate that salvianolic acid A can reverse the paclitaxel resistance and inhibit the migration and invasion abilities of human breast cancer cells by down-regulating the expression of transgelin 2, and hence could be useful in breast cancer treatments.},

abstract = {Tissues are complex systems of interacting cell types. Knowing cell-type proportions in a tissue is very important to identify which cells or cell types are targeted by a disease or perturbation. When measuring such responses using RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq masks cellular heterogeneity. Hence, several computational methods have been proposed to infer cell-type proportions from bulk RNA samples. Their performance with noisy reference profiles highly depends on the set of genes undergoing deconvolution. These genes are often selected based on prior knowledge or a single-criterion test that might not be useful to dissect closely correlated cell types. In this work, we introduce AutoGeneS, a tool that automatically extracts informative genes and reveals the cellular heterogeneity of bulk RNA samples. AutoGeneS requires no prior knowledge about marker genes and selects genes by simultaneously optimizing multiple criteria: minimizing the correlation and maximizing the distance between cell types. It can be applied to reference profiles from various sources like single-cell experiments or sorted cell populations. Results from human samples of peripheral blood illustrate that AutoGeneS outperforms other methods. Our results also highlight the impact of our approach on analyzing bulk RNA samples with noisy single-cell reference profiles and closely correlated cell types. Ground truth cell proportions analyzed by flow cytometry confirmed the accuracy of the predictions of AutoGeneS in identifying cell-type proportions. AutoGeneS is available for use via a standalone Python package (https://github.com/theislab/AutoGeneS).},

PRDX3, which is predominantly localized in mitochondria and up-regulated in several human cancers, seems to confer increased treatment resistance and aggressive phenotypes. This study examined the expression profile of PRDX3 and its possible clinical value in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). The expression of PRDX3 in LSCC samples was confirmed by Western blotting and further analyzed by immunohistochemistry in LSCC samples of different clinical pathological stages. The results showed that up-regulated expression of PRDX3 was observed in LSCC and associated with poor differentiation (P {\textless} 0.01), primary tumor location, N category and tumor stage (P {\textless} 0.05). Knockdown of PRDX3 in the Hep-2 laryngeal carcinoma epithelial cell line significantly enhanced Hep-2 cells' apoptosis and inhibited their proliferation and migration. Taken together, our results suggest that PRDX3 has substantial clinical impact on the progression of LSCC and shed new light on the role of PRDX3 in treatment resistance and aggressive phenotypes in LSCC.},

Here, we identify an unexpected regulatory mechanism by which promoter-specific binding, and therefore function, of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) in adipocytes requires G protein suppressor 2 (GPS2) to prime the local chromatin environment via inhibition of the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 and stabilization of the H3K9 histone demethylase KDM4A/JMJD2. Integration of genome-wide profiling data indicates that the pioneering activity of GPS2/KDM4A is required for PPAR$\gamma$-mediated regulation of a specific transcriptional program, including the lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Hence, our findings reveal that GPS2 exerts a biologically important function in adipose tissue lipid mobilization by directly regulating ubiquitin signaling and indirectly modulating chromatin remodeling to prime selected genes for activation. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Network concepts are increasingly used in biology and genetics. For example, the clustering coefficient has been used to understand network architecture; the connectivity (also known as degree) has been used to screen for cancer targets; and the topological overlap matrix has been used to define modules and to annotate genes. Dozens of potentially useful network concepts are known from graph theory. RESULTS: Here we study network concepts in special types of networks, which we refer to as approximately factorizable networks. In these networks, the pairwise connection strength (adjacency) between 2 network nodes can be factored into node specific contributions, named node 'conformity'. The node conformity turns out to be highly related to the connectivity. To provide a formalism for relating network concepts to each other, we define three types of network concepts: fundamental-, conformity-based-, and approximate conformity-based concepts. Fundamental concepts include the standard definitions of connectivity, density, centralization, heterogeneity, clustering coefficient, and topological overlap. The approximate conformity-based analogs of fundamental network concepts have several theoretical advantages. First, they allow one to derive simple relationships between seemingly disparate networks concepts. For example, we derive simple relationships between the clustering coefficient, the heterogeneity, the density, the centralization, and the topological overlap. The second advantage of approximate conformity-based network concepts is that they allow one to show that fundamental network concepts can be approximated by simple functions of the connectivity in module networks. CONCLUSION: Using protein-protein interaction, gene co-expression, and simulated data, we show that a) many networks comprised of module nodes are approximately factorizable and b) in these types of networks, simple relationships exist between seemingly disparate network concepts.

abstract = {Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that undergo frequent fusion and fission. Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is an essential GTPase protein for both mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) fusion and cristae morphology. Under mitochondria-stress conditions, membrane-anchored L-OPA1 is proteolytically cleaved to form peripheral S-OPA1, leading to the selection of damaged mitochondria for mitophagy. However, molecular details of the selective mitochondrial fusion are less well understood. Here, we showed that L-OPA1 and cardiolipin (CL) cooperate in heterotypic mitochondrial IM fusion. We reconstituted an in vitro membrane fusion reaction using purified human L-OPA1 protein expressed in silkworm, and found that L-OPA1 on one side of the membrane and CL on the other side are sufficient for fusion. GTP-independent membrane tethering through L-OPA1 and CL primes the subsequent GTP-hydrolysis-dependent fusion, which can be modulated by the presence of S-OPA1. These results unveil the most minimal intracellular membrane fusion machinery. In contrast, independent of CL, a homotypic trans-OPA1 interaction mediates membrane tethering, thereby supporting the cristae structure. Thus, multiple OPA1 functions are modulated by local CL conditions for regulation of mitochondrial morphology and quality control.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanistic basis of transcriptional regulation has been a central focus of molecular biology since its inception. New high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have revealed that most regulatory proteins bind thousands of sites in mammalian genomes. However, the functional significance of these binding sites remains unclear. We present a quantitative model of transcriptional regulation that suggests the contribution of each binding site to tissue-specific gene expression depends strongly on its position relative to the transcription start site. For three cell types, we show that, by considering binding position, it is possible to predict relative expression levels between cell types with an accuracy approaching the level of agreement between different experimental platforms. Our model suggests that, for the transcription factors profiled in these cell types, a regulatory site's influence on expression falls off almost linearly with distance from the transcription start site in a 10 kilobase range. Binding to both evolutionarily conserved and non-conserved sequences contributes significantly to transcriptional regulation. Our approach also reveals the quantitative, tissue-specific role of individual proteins in activating or repressing transcription. These results suggest that regulator binding position plays a previously unappreciated role in influencing expression and blurs the classical distinction between proximal promoter and distal binding events.},

However, the use of high throughput experimental methods, such as ChIP-chip and ChIP-sequencing, is limited by their high cost and strong dependence on cellular type and context. We developed a computational method for the genome-wide identification of functional transcription factor binding sites based on positional weight matrices, comparative genomics, and gene expression profiling. The method was applied to Stat3, a transcription factor playing crucial roles in inflammation, immunity and oncogenesis, and able to induce distinct subsets of target genes in different cell types or conditions. A newly generated positional weight matrix enabled us to assign affinity scores of high specificity, as measured by EMSA competition assays. Phylogenetic conservation with 7 vertebrate species was used to select the binding sites most likely to be functional. Validation was carried out on predicted sites within genes identified as differentially expressed in the presence or absence of Stat3 by microarray analysis. Twelve of the fourteen sites tested were bound by Stat3 in vivo, as assessed by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, allowing us to identify 9 Stat3 transcriptional targets. Given its high validation rate, and the availability of large transcription factor-dependent gene expression datasets obtained under diverse experimental conditions, our approach appears to be a valid alternative to high-throughput experimental assays for the discovery of novel direct targets of transcription factors.},

abstract = {The process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), first noted during embryogenesis, has also been reported in tumor formation and leads to the development of metastatic growth. It is a naturally occurring process that drives the transformation of adhesive, non-mobile epithelial like cells into mobile cells with a mesenchymal phenotype that have ability to migrate to distant anatomical sites. Activating complex network of embryonic signaling pathways, including Wnt, Notch, hedgehog and transforming growth factor-$\beta$ pathways, lead to the upregulation of EMT activating transcription factors, crucial for normal tissue development and maintenance. However, deregulation of tightly regulated pathways affecting the process of EMT has been recently investigated in various human cancers. Given the critical role of EMT in metastatic tumor formation, better understanding of the mechanistic regulation provides new opportunities for the development of potential therapeutic targets of clinical importance.},

abstract = {Increasing energy expenditure through brown adipocyte recruitment is a promising approach to combat obesity. We report here the comprehensive profiling of the epigenome and transcriptome throughout the lineage commitment and differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cell line into brown adipocytes. Through direct comparison to datasets from differentiating white adipocytes, we systematically identify stage- and lineage-specific coding genes, lncRNAs and microRNAs. Utilizing chromatin state maps, we also define stage- and lineage-specific enhancers, including super-enhancers, and their associated transcription factor binding motifs and genes. Through these analyses, we found that in brown adipocytes, brown lineage-specific genes are pre-marked by both H3K4me1 and H3K27me3, and the removal of H3K27me3 at the late stage is necessary but not sufficient to promote brown gene expression, while the pre-deposition of H3K4me1 plays an essential role in poising the brown genes for expression in mature brown cells. Moreover, we identify SOX13 as part of a p38 MAPK dependent transcriptional response mediating early brown cell lineage commitment. We also identify and subsequently validate PIM1, SIX1 and RREB1 as novel regulators promoting brown adipogenesis. Finally, we show that SIX1 binds to adipogenic and brown marker genes and interacts with C/EBP$\alpha$, C/EBP$\beta$ and EBF2, suggesting their functional cooperation during adipogenesis.},

abstract = {Adipogenesis of preadipocytes in culture has been frequently used to study the molecular basis and effect of drugs on fat cell conversion. However, after adipogenic induction, cells respond to the inducing agent with various speeds of conversion and fat accumulation, which complicates direct molecular and biochemical analyses. Here we present a simple and sensitive method to detect and quantify fat accumulation inside cells by flow cytometry. Using this method, we detected elevated levels of cytoplasmic granularity that correlated well with an increased level of fat accumulated inside cells after adipogenic conversion. We further demonstrated the ability of this method to monitor and quantify fat cell maturation within a complex population of cells and to identify and collect the fat cells with similar fat storage for further analysis. Flow cytometry offers distinct advantages over existing detection systems for cytoplasmic lipid staining and lipid extraction and could represent a powerful analytical tool to monitor the effect of chemicals and biological molecules on fat cell conversion and maturation. Moreover, in combination with a cell sorting facility, our method offers a simple and efficient means of collecting fat cells of specific status for further analysis.},

abstract = {Obesity and related metabolic disorders constitute one of the most pressing heath concerns worldwide. Increased adiposity is linked to autophagy upregulation in adipose tissues. However, it is unknown how autophagy is upregulated and contributes to aberrant adiposity. Here we show a FoxO1-autophagy-FSP27 axis that regulates adipogenesis and lipid droplet (LD) growth in adipocytes. Adipocyte differentiation was associated with upregulation of autophagy and fat specific protein 27 (FSP27), a key regulator of adipocyte maturation and expansion by promoting LD formation and growth. However, FoxO1 specific inhibitor AS1842856 potently suppressed autophagy, FSP27 expression, and adipocyte differentiation. In terminally differentiated adipocytes, AS1842856 significantly reduced FSP27 level and LD size, which was recapitulated by autophagy inhibitors (bafilomycin-A1 and leupeptin, BL). Similarly, AS1842856 and BL dampened autophagy activity and FSP27 expression in explant cultures of white adipose tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing FoxO1 in the regulation of adipose autophagy, shedding light on the mechanism of increased autophagy and adiposity in obese individuals. Given that adipogenesis and adipocyte expansion contribute to aberrant adiposity, targeting the FoxO1-autophagy-FSP27 axis may lead to new anti-obesity options.},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: The thiazolidinedione (TZD) rosiglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\gamma$ agonist that induces adipocyte differentiation and, hence, lipid accumulation. This is in apparent contrast to the long-term glucose-lowering, insulin-sensitising effect of rosiglitazone. We tested whether the action of rosiglitazone involves specific effects on mature adipocytes, which are different from those on preadipocytes. Materials and methods: Differentiated mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used as an in vitro model. Transcriptomics, proteomics and assays of metabolism were applied to assess the effect of rosiglitazone in different insulin and glucose conditions. Results: Rosiglitazone does not induce an increase, but rather a decrease in the lipid content of mature adipocytes. Analysis of transcriptome data, confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and measurements of lipolysis, indicates that an altered energy metabolism may underlie this change. The pathway analysis shows a consistent picture dominated by lipid catabolism. In addition, we confirmed at both mRNA level and protein level that rosiglitazone represses adipokine expression and production, except for genes encoding adiponectin and apolipoprotein E. Moreover, transcriptome changes indicate that a general repression of genes encoding secreted proteins occurs. Conclusions/ interpretation: Our findings suggest that the change of adiposity as seen in vivo reflects a shift in balance between the different effects of TZDs on preadipocytes and on mature adipocytes, while the changes in circulating adipokine levels primarily result from an effect on mature adipocytes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a complex cellular process having multiple roles, depending on tissue, physiological, or pathological conditions. Major post-translational regulators of autophagy are well known, however, they have not yet been collected comprehensively. The precise and context-dependent regulation of autophagy necessitates additional regulators, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional components that are listed in various datasets. Prompted by the lack of systems-level autophagy-related information, we manually collected the literature and integrated external resources to gain a high coverage autophagy database. We developed an online resource, Autophagy Regulatory Network (ARN; http://autophagy-regulation.org), to provide an integrated and systems-level database for autophagy research. ARN contains manually curated, imported, and predicted interactions of autophagy components (1,485 proteins with 4,013 interactions) in humans. We listed 413 transcription factors and 386 miRNAs that could regulate autophagy components or their protein regulators. We also connected the above-mentioned autophagy components and regulators with signaling pathways from the SignaLink 2 resource. The user-friendly website of ARN allows researchers without computational background to search, browse, and download the database. The database can be downloaded in SQL, CSV, BioPAX, SBML, PSI-MI, and in a Cytoscape CYS file formats. ARN has the potential to facilitate the experimental validation of novel autophagy components and regulators. In addition, ARN helps the investigation of transcription factors, miRNAs and signaling pathways implicated in the control of the autophagic pathway. The list of such known and predicted regulators could be important in pharmacological attempts against cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.},

Consistent with the idea of molecular mimicry in protein interactions, RidL outcompeted TBC1D5 for binding to VPS29. Furthermore, the interaction of RidL with retromer did not interfere with retromer dimerization but was essential for association of RidL with retromer-coated vacuolar and tubular endosomes.

abstract = {The generation of NO by the various NO synthases in normal and malignant tissues is manifested by various biological effects that are involved in the regulation of cell survival, differentiation and cell death. The role of NO in the cytotoxic immune response was first revealed by demonstrating the induction of iNOS in target cells by immune cytokines (e.g. IFN-$\gamma$, IL-1, TNF-$\alpha$, etc.) and resulting in the sensitization of resistant tumor cells to death ligands-induced apoptosis. Endogenous/exogenous NO mediated its immune sensitizing effect by inhibiting NF-$\kappa$ activity and downstream, inactivating the repressor transcription factor YY1, which inhibited both Fas and DR5 expressions. In addition, NO-mediated inhibition of NF-$\kappa$ activity and inhibition downstream of its anti-apoptotic gene targets sensitized the tumor cells to apoptosis by chemotherapeutic drugs. We have identified in tumor cells a dysregulated pro-survival/anti-apoptotic loop consisting of NF-$\kappa$B/Snail/YY1/RKIP/PTEN and its modification by NO was responsible, in large, for the reversal of chemo and immune resistance and sensitization to apoptotic mechanisms by cytotoxic agents. Moreover, tumor cells treated with exogenous NO donors resulted in the inhibition of NF-$\kappa$ activity via S-nitrosylation of p50 and p65, inhibition of Snail (NF-$\kappa$ target gene), inhibition of transcription repression by S-nitrosylation of YY1 and subsequent inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), induction of RKIP (inhibition of the transcription repressor Snail), and induction of PTEN (inhibition of the repressors Snail and YY1). Further, each gene product modified by NO in the loop was involved in chemo-immunosensitization. These above findings demonstrated that NO donors interference in the regulatory circuitry result in chemo-immunosensitization and inhibition of EMT. Overall, these observations suggest the potential anti-tumor therapeutic effect of NO donors in combination with subtoxic chemo-immuno drugs. This combination acts on multiple facets including reversal of chemo-immune resistance, and inhibition of both EMT and metastasis.},

We analyzed PMNs from healthy donors or lymphoma patients for oxidative burst, phagocytosis, activation markers and IL-8 release upon TREM-1 or TLR ligation ex vivo. In addition, we performed western blot analyses to characterize the signaling events inhibited by idelalisib and other PI3K inhibitors. Upon TREM-1 ligation, the oxidative burst, degranulation, L-selectin shedding and cytokine release were all strongly reduced in the presence of idelalisib along impaired phosphorylation of P38, AKT and ERK by western blot analyses. In line with this, PMNs from patients receiving idelalisib also displayed an impaired TREM-1 mediated PMN activation ex vivo. In conclusion, PI3K inhibitors might cause a neutropenia-like susceptibility to infections in patients by leading to impaired PMN functionality. This should be considered when evaluating patients for infections treated with such inhibitors in daily clinical routine.},

abstract = {RNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of alternative splicing and other forms of alternative isoform expression. Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

Recent advances have shed light on two fundamental questions regarding gene duplication: which genes tend to undergo duplication? And how does natural selection subsequently act on them? Genomic data suggest that different gene classes tend to be retained after single-gene and whole-genome duplications. We also know that functional differences between duplicate genes can originate in several different ways, including mutations that directly impart new functions, subdivision of ancestral functions and selection for changes in gene dosage. Interestingly, in many cases the 'new' function of one copy is a secondary property that was always present, but that has been co-opted to a primary role after the duplication.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a major class of small, noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs to trigger either translational repression or mRNA degradation. They have recently been more widely investigated due to their potential role as targets for cancer therapy. Many miRNAs have been implicated in several human cancers, including breast cancer. miRNAs are known to regulate cell cycle and development, and thus may serve as useful targets for exploration in anticancer therapeutics. The link between altered miRNA signatures and breast cancer development and metastasis can be observed either through the loss of tumor suppressor miRNAs, such as let-7s, miR-30a/31/34a/125s/200s/203/205/206/342 or the overexpression of oncogenic miRNAs, such as miR-10b/21/135a/155/221/222/224/373/520c in breast cancer cells. Some of these miRNAs have also been validated in tumor specimens of breast cancer patients, underscoring their potential roles in diagnostics, as well as targets for novel therapeutics for breast cancer. In this review article, we will provide an overview and update of our current understanding of the mode of action of several of these well characterized miRNAs in breast cancer models. Therefore, better understanding of the gene networks orchestrated by these miRNAs may help exploit the full potential of miRNAs in regards to cancer diagnosis, treatment, and therapeutics.},

abstract = {The RNA-binding protein HuR regulates the stability and translation of numerous mRNAs encoding stress-response and proliferative proteins. Although its post-transcriptional influence has been linked primarily to its cytoplasmic translocation, here we report that moderate heat shock (HS) potently reduces HuR levels, thereby altering the expression of HuR target mRNAs. HS did not change HuR mRNA levels or de novo translation, but instead reduced HuR protein stability. Supporting the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in this process were results showing that (1) HuR was ubiquitinated in vitro and in intact cells, (2) proteasome inhibition increased HuR abundance after HS, and (3) the HuR kinase checkpoint kinase 2 protected against the loss of HuR by HS. Within a central, HS-labile approximately 110-amino-acid region, K182 was found to be essential for HuR ubiquitination and proteolysis as mutant HuR(K182R) was left virtually unubiquitinated and was refractory to HS-triggered degradation. Our findings reveal that HS transiently lowers HuR by proteolysis linked to K182 ubiquitination and that HuR reduction enhances cell survival following HS.},

abstract = {Lipids, which are essential constituents of biological membranes, play structural and functional roles in the cell. In recent years, certain lipids have been identified as regulatory signaling molecules and have been termed "bioactive lipids". Subsequently, the importance of bioactive lipids in stem cell differentiation and cardiogenesis has gained increasing recognition. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the biological processes underlying murine cardiac differentiation and the mechanisms by which bioactive lipids affect these processes. For this purpose, a transcriptomic meta-analysis of microarray and RNA-seq data from murine stem cells undergoing cardiogenic differentiation was performed. The differentially expressed genes identified via this meta-analysis, as well as bioactive lipids, were evaluated using systems chemo-biology tools. These data indicated that bioactive lipids are associated with the regulation of cell motility, cell adhesion, cytoskeletal rearrangement and gene expression. Moreover, bioactive lipids integrate the signaling pathways involved in cell migration, the secretion and remodeling of extracellular matrix components, and the establishment of the cardiac phenotype. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the contribution of bioactive lipids to the induction of cellular responses to various stimuli, which may originate from the extracellular environment and morphogens, and the manner in which this contribution directly affects murine heart morphogenesis.

abstract = {The fasciculation and elongation protein zeta1 (FEZ1) is a mammalian orthologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein UNC-76, which is necessary for axon growth in that nematode. In previous studies FEZ1 has been found to interact with protein kinase Czeta, DISC1, the agnoprotein of the human polyomavirus JC virus, and E4B, a U-box-type ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. We reported previously that FEZ1 and its paralogue FEZ2 are proteins that interact with NEK1, a protein kinase involved in polycystic kidney disease and DNA repair mechanisms at the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. Here we report the identification of 16 proteins that interact with human FEZ1-(221-396) in a yeast two-hybrid assay of a human fetal brain cDNA library. The 13 interacting proteins of known functions take part either in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling (6 proteins), the regulation of neuronal cell development (2 proteins) and cellular transport mechanisms (3 proteins) or participate in apoptosis (2 proteins). We were able to confirm eight of the observed interactions by in vitro pull-down assays with recombinant fusion proteins. The confirmed interacting proteins include FEZ1 itself and three transcription controlling proteins (SAP30L, DRAP1, and BAF60a). In mapping studies we found that the C-terminal regions of FEZ1, and especially its coiled-coil region, are involved in its dimerization, its heterodimerization with FEZ2, and in the interaction with 10 of the identified interacting proteins. Our results give further support to the previous speculation of the functional involvement of FEZ1 in neuronal development but suggest further that FEZ1 may also be involved in transcriptional control.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE HIV lipodystrophy is characterised by abnormal adipose tissue distribution and metabolism, as a result of altered adipocyte function and gene expression. The protease inhibitor ritonavir is associated with the development of lipodystrophy. Quantifying changes in adipogenic gene expression in the presence of ritonavir may help to identify therapeutic targets for HIV lipodystrophy. METHODS Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 oligonucleotide microarray was used to investigate gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with 20 µmol/l ritonavir or vehicle control (ethanol). Pparg, Adipoq, Retn and Il6 expression were validated by real time RT-PCR. Transcriptional signalling through PPAR-$\gamma$ was investigated using a DNA-binding ELISA. Changes in adipocyte function were investigated through secreted adiponectin quantification using ELISA and Oil Red O staining for triglyceride storage. RESULTS Expression of 389 genes was altered by more than 5-fold in the presence of ritonavir (all P {\textless} 0.001). Gene ontology analysis revealed down-regulation of genes responsible for adipocyte triglyceride accumulation including complement factor D (Cfd; 238.42-fold), Cidec (73.75-fold) and Pparg (5.63-fold). Glucose transport genes were also down-regulated including Adipoq (24.42-fold) and Glut4 (13.36-fold), while Il6 was up-regulated (10.39-fold). PPAR-$\gamma$ regulatory genes Cebpa (11.33-fold) and liver-X-receptor $\alpha$ (Nr1h3) were down-regulated. Changes in Pparg, Adipoq and Il6 were confirmed by RT-PCR. PPAR-$\gamma$ binding to its nuclear consensus site, adiponectin secretion and triglyceride accumulation were all reduced by ritonavir. CONCLUSION Ritonavir had a significant effect on expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, lipid accumulation and glucose metabolism. Down-regulation of Pparg may be mediated by changes in Cebpa, Lcn2 and Nr1h3.},

In this study, we determined that WIPI1, an ATG18 homologue that is shown to localize to both autophagosomes and early endosomes, inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) signaling, leading to increased transcription of melanogenic enzymes and the formation of mature melanosomes. WIPI1 suppressed the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) activity, resulting in glycogen synthase kinase 3$\beta$ inhibition, $\beta$-Catenin stabilization, and increased transcription of microphthalmia transcription factor and its target genes. WIPI1-depleted cells accumulated stage I melanosomes but lacked stage III-IV melanosomes. Inhibition of TORC1 by rapamycin treatment resulted in the accumulation of stage IV melanosomes but not autophagosomes, whereas starvation resulted in the formation of autophagosomes but not melanin accumulation. Taken together, our studies define a distinct role for WIPI1 and TORC1 signaling in controlling the transcription of melanogenic enzymes and melanosome maturation, a process that is distinct from starvation-induced autophagy.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Large-scale gene expression data comprising a variety of cellular conditions hold the promise of a global view on the transcription program. While conventional clustering algorithms have been successfully applied to smaller datasets, the utility of many algorithms for the analysis of large-scale data is limited by their inability to capture combinatorial and condition-specific co-regulation. In addition, there is an increasing need to integrate the rapidly accumulating body of other high-throughput biological data with the expression analysis. In a previous work, we introduced the signature algorithm, which overcomes the problems of conventional clustering and allows for intuitive integration of additional biological data. However, this approach is constrained by the comprehensiveness of relevant external data and its lacking ability to capture hierarchical modularity. METHODS: We present a novel method for the analysis of large-scale expression data, which assigns genes into context-dependent and potentially overlapping regulatory units. We introduce the notion of a transcription module as a self-consistent regulatory unit consisting of a set of co-regulated genes as well as the experimental conditions that induce their co-regulation. Self-consistency is defined by a rigorous mathematical criterion. We propose an efficient algorithm to identify such modules, which is based on the iterative application of the signature algorithm. A threshold parameter that determines the resolution of the modular decomposition is introduced. RESULTS: The method is applied systematically to over 1000 expression profiles of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the results are presented using two complementary visualization schemes we developed. The average biological coherence, as measured by the conservation of putative cis-regulatory motifs between four related yeast species, is higher for transcription modules than for clusters identified by other methods applied to the same dataset. Our method is related to singular value decomposition (SVD) and to the pairwise average linkage clustering algorithm. It extends SVD by filtering out noise in the expression data and offering variable resolution to reveal hierarchical organization. It furthermore has the advantage over both methods of capturing overlapping modules in the presence of combinatorial regulation.

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing has greatly increased the scope and the resolution of transcriptional regulation study. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and ChIP-Seq experiments are now generating comprehensive data on transcript abundance and on regulator-DNA interactions. We propose an approach for an integrated analysis of these data based on feature extraction of ChIP-Seq signals, principal component analysis, and regression-based component selection. Compared with traditional methods, our approach not only offers higher power in predicting gene expression from ChIP-Seq data but also provides a way to capture cooperation among regulators. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we find that a remarkably high proportion of variation in gene expression (65{\%}) can be explained by the binding signals of 12 transcription factors (TFs). Two groups of TFs are identified. Whereas the first group (E2f1, Myc, Mycn, and Zfx) act as activators in general, the second group (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Smad1, Stat3, Tcfcp2l1, and Esrrb) may serve as either activator or repressor depending on the target. The two groups of TFs cooperate tightly to activate genes that are differentially up-regulated in ESCs. In the absence of binding by the first group, the binding of the second group is associated with genes that are repressed in ESCs and derepressed upon early differentiation.},

abstract = {Mice deficient in C/EBP alpha have defective development of adipose tissue, but the precise role of C/EBP alpha has not been defined. Fibroblasts from C/EBP alpha(-/-) mice undergo adipose differentiation through expression and activation of PPAR gamma, though several clear defects are apparent. C/EBP alpha-deficient adipocytes accumulates less lipid, and they do not induce endogenous PPAR gamma, indicating that cross-regulation between C/EBP alpha and PPAR gamma is important in maintaining the differentiated state. The cells also show a complete absence of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, secondary to reduced gene expression and tyrosine phosphorylation for the insulin receptor and IRS-1. These results define multiple roles for C/EBP alpha in adipogenesis and show that cross-regulation between PPAR gamma and C/EBP alpha is a key component of the transcriptional control of this cell lineage.},

abstract = {Autophagy plays a critical role in maintaining cell homeostasis in response to various stressors through protein conjugation and activation of lysosome-dependent degradation. MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) is conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the membranes and regulates initiation of autophagy through interaction with many autophagy-related proteins possessing an LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is composed of 2 hydrophobic amino acids (tryptophan and leucine) separated by 2 non-conserved amino acids (WXXL). In this study, we identified a new putative LIR motif in PEBP1/RKIP (phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1) that was originally isolated as a PE-binding protein and also a cellular inhibitor of MAPK/ERK signaling. PEBP1 was specifically bound to PE-unconjugated LC3 in cells, and mutation (WXXL mutated to AXXA) of this LIR motif disrupted its interaction with LC3 proteins. Interestingly, overexpression of PEBP1 significantly inhibited starvation-induced autophagy by activating the AKT and MTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin [serine/threonine kinase] complex 1) signaling pathway and consequently suppressing the ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) activity. In contrast, ablation of PEBP1 expression dramatically promoted the autophagic process under starvation conditions. Furthermore, PEBP1 lacking the LIR motif highly stimulated starvation-induced autophagy through the AKT-MTORC1-dependent pathway. PEBP1 phosphorylation at Ser153 caused dissociation of LC3 from the PEBP1-LC3 complex for autophagy induction. PEBP1-dependent suppression of autophagy was not associated with the MAPK pathway. These findings suggest that PEBP1 can act as a negative mediator in autophagy through stimulation of the AKT-MTORC1 pathway and direct interaction with LC3.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our pilot study using miRNA PCR array found that miRNA-29b (miR-29b)  is differentially expressed in primary cultured CD133-positive A549 cells compared with CD133-negative A549 cells. METHODS: Ten human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and samples from thirty patients with NSCLC were analyzed for the expression of miR-29b by quantitative RT-PCR. Bioinformatics analysis combined with tumor metastasis PCR array showed the potential target genes for miR-29b. miR-29b lentivirus and inhibitors were transfected into NSCLC cells to investigate its role on regulating cell proliferation which was measured by CCK-8 assay in vitro and nude mice xenograft tumor assay in vivo. Cell motility ability was evaluated by transwell assay. The target genes of miR-29b were determined by luciferase assay, quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis combined with tumor metastasis PCR array showed that matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and PTEN could be important target genes of miR-29b. The expression of miR-29b was down regulated in NSCLC tissues compared to the normal tissues. Clinicopathological analysis demonstrated that miR-29b had significant negative correlation with lymphatic metastasis. The gain-of-function studies revealed that ectopic expression of miR-29b decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of NSCLC cells. In contrasts, loss-of-function studies showed that inhibition of miR-29b promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro. Nude mice xenograft tumor assay confirmed that miR-29b inhibited lung cancer growth in vivo. High-invasion (A549-H) and low-invasion (A549-L) NSCLC cell sublines from A549 cells were created by using the repeated transwell assay aimed to confirm the effect of miR-29b on migration and invasion of NSCLC. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-29b inhibited the expression of the luciferase gene containing the 3'-UTRs of MMP2 and PTEN mRNA. Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR indicated that miR-29b down-regulated the expression of MMP2 at the protein and mRNA levels. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-29b serves as a tumor metastasis suppressor, which suppresses NSCLC cell metastasis by directly inhibiting MMP2 expression. The results show that miR-29b may be a novel therapeutic candidate target to slow NSCLC metastasis.},

abstract = {Advances in genomic profiling present new challenges of explaining how changes in DNA and RNA are translated into proteins linking genotype to phenotype. Here we compare the genome-scale proteomic and transcriptomic changes in human primary haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and erythroid progenitors, and uncover pathways related to mitochondrial biogenesis enhanced through post-transcriptional regulation. Mitochondrial factors including TFAM and PHB2 are selectively regulated through protein translation during erythroid specification. Depletion of TFAM in erythroid cells alters intracellular metabolism, leading to elevated histone acetylation, deregulated gene expression, and defective mitochondria and erythropoiesis. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signalling is enhanced to promote translation of mitochondria-associated transcripts through TOP-like motifs. Genetic and pharmacological perturbation of mitochondria or mTORC1 specifically impairs erythropoiesis in vitro and in vivo. Our studies support a mechanism for post-transcriptional control of erythroid mitochondria and may have direct relevance to haematologic defects associated with mitochondrial diseases and ageing.},

abstract = {Bioinformatic approaches are intended to provide systems level insight into the complex biological processes that underlie serious diseases such as cancer. In this review we describe current bioinformatic resources, and illustrate how they have been used to study a clinically important example: epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and is often diagnosed at advanced stages, leading to limited therapeutic success. While EMT is essential during development and wound healing, pathological reactivation of this program by cancer cells contributes to metastasis and drug resistance, both major causes of death from lung cancer. Challenges of studying EMT include its transient nature, its molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity, and the complicated networks of rewired signaling cascades. Given the biology of lung cancer and the role of EMT, it is critical to better align the two in order to advance the impact of precision oncology. This task relies heavily on the application of bioinformatic resources. Besides summarizing recent work in this area, we use four EMT-associated genes, TGF-beta (TGFB1), NEDD9/HEF1, beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and E-cadherin (CDH1), as exemplars to demonstrate the current capacities and limitations of probing bioinformatic resources to inform hypothesis-driven studies with therapeutic goals.},

abstract = {The African lungfish, Protopterus annectens, can undergo aestivation during drought. Aestivation has three phases: induction, maintenance and arousal. The objective of this study was to examine the differential gene expression in the brain of P. annectens during the induction (6 days) and maintenance (6 months) phases of aestivation as compared with the freshwater control using suppression subtractive hybridization. During the induction phase of aestivation, the mRNA expression of prolactin (prl) and growth hormone were up-regulated in the brain of P. annectens, which indicate for the first time the possible induction role of these two hormones in aestivation. Also, the up-regulation of mRNA expression of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein $\gamma$ polypeptide and the down-regulation of phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein, suggest that there could be a reduction in biological and neuronal activities in the brain. The mRNA expression of cold inducible RNA-binding protein and glucose regulated protein 58 were also up-regulated in the brain, probably to enhance their cytoprotective effects. Furthermore, the down-regulation of prothymosin $\alpha$ expression suggests that there could be a suppression of transcription and cell proliferation in preparation for the maintenance phase. In general, the induction phase appeared to be characterized by reduction in glycolytic capacity and metabolic activity, suppression of protein synthesis and degradation, and an increase in defense against ammonia toxicity. In contrast, there was a down-regulation in the mRNA expression of prl in the brain of P. annectens during the maintenance phase of aestivation. In addition, there could be an increase in oxidative defense capacity, and up-regulation of transcription, translation, and glycolytic capacities in preparation for arousal. Overall, our results signify the importance of reconstruction of protein structures and regulation of energy expenditure during the induction phase, and the needs to suppress protein degradation and conserve metabolic fuel stores during the maintenance phase of aestivation.},

abstract = {Insulin activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) regulates metabolism, including the translocation of the Glut4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane and inactivation of the FoxO1 transcription factor. Adenoviral protein E4-ORF1 stimulates cellular glucose metabolism by mimicking growth-factor activation of PI3K. We have used E4-ORF1 as a tool to dissect PI3K-mediated signaling in adipocytes. E4-ORF1 activation of PI3K in adipocytes recapitulates insulin regulation of FoxO1 but not regulation of Glut4. This uncoupling of PI3K effects occurs despite E4-ORF1 activating PI3K and downstream signaling to levels achieved by insulin. Although E4-ORF1 does not fully recapitulate insulin's effects on Glut4, it enhances insulin-stimulated insertion of Glut4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane independent of Rab10, a key regulator of Glut4 trafficking. E4-ORF1 also stimulates plasma membrane translocation of ubiquitously expressed Glut1 glucose transporter, an effect that is likely essential for E4-ORF1 to promote an anabolic metabolism in a broad range of cell types.},

abstract = {Overexpression of p68 has been reported in various types of cancer. However, little study has been conducted on the expression and role of p68 in cervical cancer. Therefore, the present study focuses on the role of p68 in cervical cancer cells, which may elucidate its potential mechanism of cervical cancer progression and shed light on the precision medical treatment of cervical cancer. Firstly, the expression of p68 was analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The changes to cell morphology were observed using an inverted microscope (XDS-500D; Shanghai Caikon Optical Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Cell migration was determined using an in vitro scratch assay. The present study demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of p68 were significantly enhanced in cervical cancer CaSki, HeLa [human papillomavirus (HPV)-18-positive], SiHa (HPV-16-positive) and C-33A (HPV-negative) cell lines compared with the human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line. Overexpression of p68 induced an elongated and spindle-shaped morphology in CaSki cells. Upregulation of p68 increased the expression of $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin, vimentin and fibronectin however, epithelial marker E-cadherin was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the in vitro scratch assay demonstrated that overexpression of p68 markedly enhanced CaSki cell migration capacity at 24 and 48 h. Knockdown of p68 partially reversed transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1)-induced changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and cell morphological changes. In summary, the present study demonstrated that p68 transcriptionally activated the expression of TGF-$\beta$1, thereby prompting EMT in cervical cancer cells.},

The distribution of drugs in the internal and external environment of the tumor cells is tightly linked with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Recent studies have shown that ABC transporters expression changed continuously during EMT. We believe that EMT is an important regulator of ABC transporters. In this review, we discuss how EMT regulates ABC transporters and their potential linkages. And we hope the knowledge of EMT and ABC transporters will offer more effective targets to experimental research.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression in most biological processes. They act by guiding the RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC) to partially complementary sequences in target mRNAs to suppress gene expression by a combination of translation inhibition and mRNA decay. The commonly accepted mechanism of miRNA targeting in animals involves an interaction between the 5'-end of the miRNA called the 'seed region' and the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the mRNA. Many target prediction algorithms are based around such a model, though increasing evidence demonstrates that targeting can also be mediated through sites other than the 3'-UTR and that seed region base pairing is not always required. The power and validity of such in silico data can be therefore hindered by the simplified rules used to represent targeting interactions. Experimentation is essential to identify genuine miRNA targets, however many experimental modalities exist and their limitations need to be understood. This review summarizes and critiques the existing experimental techniques for miRNA target identification.},

abstract = {Breast cancer has been shown to live in the tumor microenvironment, which consists of not only breast cancer cells themselves but also a significant amount of pathophysiologically altered surrounding stroma and cells. Diverse components of the breast cancer microenvironment, such as suppressive immune cells, re-programmed fibroblast cells, altered extracellular matrix (ECM) and certain soluble factors, synergistically impede an effective anti-tumor response and promote breast cancer progression and metastasis. Among these components, stromal cells in the breast cancer microenvironment are characterized by molecular alterations and aberrant signaling pathways, whereas the ECM features biochemical and biomechanical changes. However, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subtype of this disease that lacks effective therapies available for other subtypes, is considered to feature a unique microenvironment distinct from that of other subtypes, especially compared to Luminal A subtype. Because these changes are now considered to significantly impact breast cancer development and progression, these unique alterations may serve as promising prognostic factors of clinical outcome or potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TNBC. In this review, we focus on the composition of the TNBC microenvironment, concomitant distinct biological alteration, specific interplay between various cell types and TNBC cells, and the prognostic implications of these findings.},

abstract = {Temporal organization of tissue metabolism is important for maintaining nutrient and energy homeostasis in mammals. Autophagy is a conserved cellular pathway that is activated in response to nutrient limitation, resulting in the degradation of cytoplasmic components and the release of amino acids and other nutrients. Here, we show that autophagy exhibits robust circadian rhythm in mouse liver, which is accompanied by cyclic induction of genes involved in various steps of autophagy. Functional analyses of transcription factors and cofactors identified C/EBP$\beta$ as a potent activator of autophagy. C/EBP$\beta$ is rhythmically expressed in the liver and is regulated by both circadian and nutritional signals. In cultured primary hepatocytes, C/EBP$\beta$ stimulates the program of autophagy gene expression and is sufficient to activate autophagic protein degradation. Adenoviral-mediated RNAi knockdown of C/EBP$\beta$ in vivo abolishes diurnal autophagy rhythm in the liver. Further, circadian regulation of C/EBP$\beta$ and autophagy is disrupted in mice lacking a functional liver clock. We have thus identified C/EBP$\beta$ as a key factor that links autophagy to biological clock and maintains nutrient homeostasis throughout light/dark cycles. {\textcopyright} 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent studies suggest that, even within a single adipose depot, there may be distinct subpopulations of adipocytes. To investigate this cellular heterogeneity, we have developed multiple conditionally immortalized clonal preadipocyte lines from white adipose tissue of mice. Analysis of these clones reveals at least three white adipocyte subpopulations. These subpopulations have differences in metabolism and differentially respond to inflammatory cytokines, insulin, and growth hormones. These also have distinct gene expression profiles and can be tracked by differential expression of three marker genes: Wilms' tumor 1, transgelin, and myxovirus 1. Lineage tracing analysis with dual‐fluorescent reporter mice indicates that these adipocyte subpopulations have differences in gene expression and metabolism that mirror those observed in the clonal cell lines. Furthermore, preadipocytes and adipocytes from these subpopulations differ in their abundance in different fat depots. Thus, white adipose tissue, even in a single depot, is comprised of distinct subpopulations of white adipocytes with different physiological phenotypes. These differences in adipocyte composition may contribute to the differences in metabolic behavior and physiology of different fat depots.},

abstract = {Advanced stages of papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer continue to be plagued by a dismal prognosis, which is a result of limited effective therapies for these cancers. Due to the high proportion of thyroid cancers harboring mutations in the MAPK pathway, the MAPK pathway has become a focal point for therapeutic intervention in thyroid cancer. Unfortunately, unlike melanoma, a similar responsiveness to MAPK pathway inhibition has yet to be observed in thyroid cancer patients. To address this issue, we have focused on targeting the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, and we and others have demonstrated that targeting Src results in inhibition of growth, invasion, and migration both in vitro and in vivo, which can be enhanced through the combined inhibition of Src and the MAPK pathway. Therefore, we examined the efficacy of the combination therapy across a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines representing common oncogenic drivers (BRAF, RAS, and PIK3CA). Interestingly, combined inhibition of Src and the MAPK pathway overcomes intrinsic dasatinib resistance in cell lines where both the MAPK and PI3K pathways are inhibited, which we show is likely due to the regulation of the PI3K pathway by Src in these responsive cells. Interestingly, we have mapped downstream phosphorylation of rpS6 as a key biomarker of response, and cells that maintain rpS6 phosphorylation likely represent drug tolerant persisters. Altogether, the combined inhibition of Src and the MAPK pathway holds great promise for improving the overall survival of advanced thyroid cancer patients with BRAF and RAS mutations, and activation of the PI3K pathway and rpS6 phosphorylation represent important biomarkers of response for patients treated with this therapy.},

We included randomized placebo-controlled trials that reported the effects of anti-obesity drugs on cardiovascular risk factors compared to placebo. Overall, orlistat produced a reduction of 2.39 kg (95{\%}CI-3.34 to -1.45) for weight, a reduction of 0.27 mmol/L (95{\%}CI: -0.36 to -0.17) for total cholesterol, a reduction of 0.21 mmol/L (95{\%}CI: -0.30 to -0.12) for LDL, a reduction of 0.12 mmol/L (95{\%}CI: -0.20 to -0.04) for fasting glucose, 1.85 mmHg reduction (95{\%}CI: -3.30 to -0.40) for SBP, and a reduction of 1.49 mmHg (95{\%}CI: -2.39 to -0.58) for DBP. Sibutramine only showed effects on weight loss and triglycerides reduction with statistical significances. Rimonabant was associated with statistically significant effects on weight loss, SBP reduction and DBP reduction.

Specifically, we use our approach to fit models using a smooth nonlinear formalism for modeling gene regulation (gene circuits) as well as models using logical rules based on activation and repression thresholds for transcription factors. Our technique also allows us to infer regulatory relationships de novo or to test network structures suggested by the literature. We fit a series of models to test several outstanding questions about gap gene regulation, including regulation of and by hunchback and the role of autoactivation. Based on our modeling results and validation against the experimental literature, we propose a revised network structure for the gap gene system.

While a handful of reports have demonstrated the potential of supervised computational methods to deconvolute tissue heterogeneity, these approaches require a priori information on the marker genes or composition of known subpopulations. To address the critical problem of the absence of validated marker genes for many (including novel) subpopulations, we describe convex analysis of mixtures (CAM), a fully unsupervised in silico method, for identifying subpopulation marker genes directly from the original mixed gene expressions in scatter space that can improve molecular analyses in many biological contexts. Validated with predesigned mixtures, CAM on the gene expression data from peripheral leukocytes, brain tissue, and yeast cell cycle, revealed novel marker genes that were otherwise undetectable using existing methods. Importantly, CAM requires no a priori information on the number, identity, or composition of the subpopulations present in mixed samples, and does not require the presence of pure subpopulations in sample space. This advantage is significant in that CAM can achieve all of its goals using only a small number of heterogeneous samples, and is more powerful to distinguish between phenotypically similar subpopulations.},

This study examines how genomics scientists' perceived priorities for data quality and data quality skills differ when assuming different roles played in genomics data curation work. The analysis of survey data collected from 147 genomics scientists found that curators of genomics data valued quality criteria that can be assessed through direct examination of the data more highly, while end users placed a high value on the quality criteria that can be assessed indirectly, such as believability. With regard to data quality skills, curators appeared to care more about understanding user's requirements and specific data management skills than end users, while end users valued the skills needed to deal with information overload more highly — those needed to identify useful, relevant information from large amounts of data. Scientists with different curation roles, given common curation tasks with the same skill requirements, prioritized different data quality criteria.

abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that newly emerging transformed cells are often apically extruded from epithelial tissues. During this process, normal epithelial cells can recognize and actively eliminate transformed cells, a process called epithelial defence against cancer (EDAC). Here, we show that mitochondrial membrane potential is diminished in RasV12-transformed cells when they are surrounded by normal cells. In addition, glucose uptake is elevated, leading to higher lactate production. The mitochondrial dysfunction is driven by upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), which positively regulates elimination of RasV12-transformed cells. Furthermore, EDAC from the surrounding normal cells, involving filamin, drives the Warburg-effect-like metabolic alteration. Moreover, using a cell-competition mouse model, we demonstrate that PDK-mediated metabolic changes promote the elimination of RasV12-transformed cells from intestinal epithelia. These data indicate that non-cell-autonomous metabolic modulation is a crucial regulator for cell competition, shedding light on the unexplored events at the initial stage of carcinogenesis. It remains enigmatic what happens at the initial stage of carcinogene-sis, where oncogenic transformation occurs in a single cell within the epithelium 1–3 . Recent studies have demonstrated that newly emerging transformed cells are often eliminated from epithelial tissues via cell competition against the neighbouring normal epithelial cells. Cell competition is a process by which two different cell populations, upon interaction, compete with each other for survival and space;},

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) cooperate with TFs and epigenetic alterations to constitute a hierarchical complexity in transcriptional gene regulation. While clearly implicated in biological processes, our understanding of these complex regulatory mechanisms is still limited and incomplete. Various online software have been proposed for uncovering transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks, however, there is a lack of effective web-based software capable of constructing underlying interactive organizations between post-translational and transcriptional regulatory components. Here, we present an open web server, post-translational hierarchical gene regulatory network (PTHGRN) to unravel relationships among PTMs, TFs, epigenetic modifications and gene expression. PTHGRN utilizes a graphical Gaussian model with partial least squares regression-based methodology, and is able to integrate protein-protein interactions, ChIP-seq and gene expression data and to capture essential regulation features behind high-throughput data. The server provides an integrative platform for users to analyze ready-to-use public high-throughput Omics resources or upload their own data for systems biology study. Users can choose various parameters in the method, build network topologies of interests and dissect their associations with biological functions. Application of the software to stem cell and breast cancer demonstrates that it is an effective tool for understanding regulatory mechanisms in biological complex systems.

The crude extract from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 was the most active in inhibiting cell proliferation. Extensive bioassay-guided purification and mass spectrometric characterization allowed the identification of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) as the molecule responsible for this bioactivity. We further demonstrate that 4-HBA inhibits A549 cancer cell proliferation with an IC 50 value ≤ 1 $\mu$g ml -1 , and that the effect is specific, since the other two HBA isomers (i.e. 2-HBA and 3-HBA) were unable to inhibit cell proliferation. The effect of 4-HBA is also selective since treatment of normal lung epithelial cells (WI-38) with 4-HBA did not affect cell viability. Finally, we show that 4-HBA is able to activate, at the gene and protein levels, a specific cell death signaling pathway named pyroptosis. Accordingly, the treatment of A549 cells with 4-HBA induces the transcription of (amongst others) caspase-1, IL1$\beta$, and IL18 encoding genes. Studies needed for the elucidation of mode of action of 4-HBA will be instrumental in depicting novel details of pyroptosis.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

Here, we demonstrate that Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) regulates the activation of MAPK when B-Raf signaling is defective. We used multiple models including mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and primary keratinocytes from RKIP- or Raf-deficient mice as well as allografts in mice to investigate the mechanism. Loss of B-Raf protein or activity significantly reduces MAPK activation in these cells. We show that RKIP depletion can rescue the compromised ERK activation and promote proliferation, and this rescue occurs through a Raf-1 dependent mechanism. These results provide formal evidence that RKIP is a bona fide regulator of Raf-1. We propose a new model in which RKIP plays a key role in regulating the ability of cells to signal through Raf-1 to ERK in B-Raf compromised cells. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Activation of p110$\beta$ is specifically implicated in various physiological and pathophysiological processes, such as the growth of tumors deficient in phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN). To determine the specific contribution of GPCR signaling to p110$\beta$-dependent functions, we identified the site in p110b that binds to the G$\beta$$\gamma$ subunit of G proteins. Mutation of this site eliminated G$\beta$$\gamma$-dependent activation of PI3K$\beta$ (a dimer of p110b and the p85 regulatory subunit) in vitro and in cells, without affecting basal activity or phosphotyrosine peptide-mediated activation. Disrupting the p110$\beta$-G$\beta$$\gamma$ interaction by mutation or with a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor blocked the transforming capacity of PI3Kb in fibroblasts and reduced the proliferation, chemotaxis, and invasiveness of PTEN-null tumor cells in culture. Our data suggest that specifically targeting GPCR signaling to PI3K$\beta$ could provide a therapeutic approach for tumors that depend on p110$\beta$ for growth and metastasis.},

However, hepatitis C virus (HCV) reinfection occurs in almost all recipients and usually leads to progressive fibrosis and graft failure. Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-beta) plays a part in transplanted liver cirrhosis, but nothing is known about the possible role of genetic diversity of TGF-beta receptor system. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate whether genetic variation in 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of TGF-beta receptor type I (TGFBR1) gene is associated with recurrence and severity of hepatitis C and liver fibrosis following OLT in HCV-infected patients., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included 95 chronic hepatitis C patients following OLT. The recipients and donors were genotyped for 49245A{\textgreater}G (rs868) and 51976G{\textgreater}A (rs334349) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)., RESULTS: Donor rs868 AA genotype was strongly associated with worse clinical course of recurrent hepatitis C. The rs868 AA group displayed more severe symptoms of hepatitis C during the follow-up and the fibrosis score in this group was significantly higher 3 years after OLT., CONCLUSIONS: Clinical course of hepatitis C after OLT may depend on donor rs868 SNP located in TGFBR1 3'UTR.},

The anti-inflammatory effect of adenine has been previously reported by our laboratory and others. However, the mechanism of action has different opinions and remains unclear in monocyte. Here, adenine was found to significantly inhibit the secretion of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$ and IL-6 in THP-1 cells. The bioinformatic analysis results showed that the anti-inflammatory function is possibly due to the inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B signaling. And this result is confirmed by using immunocytochemistry. Moreover, this effect can be suppressed by the AMPK inhibitor. Results also showed that adenine can activate AMPK and its multiple downstream targets. Data from mass spectrometry showed that adenine promotes significant elevation of intracellular AMP. Our data indicate that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of adenine may involve adenine phosphoribosyltransferase-catalyzed intracellular AMP elevation, which stimulates AMPK activation.},

abstract = {Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) regulate transcription in part by recruiting distinct transcriptional coregulatory complexes to target gene promoters. The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) was recently purified from thyroid hormone-cultured HeLa cells in association with a complex of novel nuclear proteins termed TRAPs (thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins) ranging in size from 20 to 240 kDa. The TRAP complex markedly enhances TR-mediated transcription in vitro, suggesting a coactivator role for one or more of the TRAP components. Here we present the mouse cDNA for the 100-kDa component of the TRAP complex (mTRAP100). The mTRAP100 protein contains seven LxxLL motifs thought to be potential binding surfaces for liganded NRs, yet surprisingly fails to interact with TR and other NRs in vitro. By contrast, mTRAP100 coprecipitates in vivo with another component of the TRAP complex (TRAP220), which directly contacts TR and the vitamin D receptor in a ligand-dependent manner. Our findings thus suggest that TRAP100 is targeted to NRs in association with TRAP complexes specifically containing TRAP220. Transient overexpression of mTRAP100 in mammalian cells further enhances ligand-dependent transcription by both TR and the vitamin D receptor, revealing a functional role for mTRAP100 in NR-mediated transactivation. The presence of an intrinsic mTRAP100 transactivation function is suggested by the ability of mTRAP100 to activate transcription constitutively when tethered to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Collectively, these findings suggest that TRAP100, in concert with other TRAPs, plays an important functional role in mediating transactivation by specific NRs.},

abstract = {Background: Identifying differentially expressed genes (DEG) is a fundamental step in studies that perform genome wide expression profiling. Typically, DEG are identified by univariate approaches such as Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) or Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) for processing cDNA microarrays, and differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution (DESeq) or Empirical analysis of Digital Gene Expression data in R (edgeR) for RNA-seq profiling.Results: Here we present a new geometrical multivariate approach to identify DEG called the Characteristic Direction. We demonstrate that the Characteristic Direction method is significantly more sensitive than existing methods for identifying DEG in the context of transcription factor (TF) and drug perturbation responses over a large number of microarray experiments. We also benchmarked the Characteristic Direction method using synthetic data, as well as RNA-Seq data. A large collection of microarray expression data from TF perturbations (73 experiments) and drug perturbations (130 experiments) extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), as well as an RNA-Seq study that profiled genome-wide gene expression and STAT3 DNA binding in two subtypes of diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma, were used for benchmarking the method using real data. ChIP-Seq data identifying DNA binding sites of the perturbed TFs, as well as known drug targets of the perturbing drugs, were used as prior knowledge silver-standard for validation. In all cases the Characteristic Direction DEG calling method outperformed other methods. We find that when drugs are applied to cells in various contexts, the proteins that interact with the drug-targets are differentially expressed and more of the corresponding genes are discovered by the Characteristic Direction method. In addition, we show that the Characteristic Direction conceptualization can be used to perform improved gene set enrichment analyses when compared with the gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and the hypergeometric test.Conclusions: The application of the Characteristic Direction method may shed new light on relevant biological mechanisms that would have remained undiscovered by the current state-of-the-art DEG methods.

Until present, platinum-based chemotherapy has been the only treatment modality, able to produce a fair amount of responses but of short duration. Recently, several efforts for molecular characterization of this lethal phenotype have resulted in identification of novel signaling factors involved in microenvironment interactions, mitosis, and neural reprograming as potential therapeutic targets. Ongoing clinical testing of specific inhibitors of these targets, for example, Aurora kinase A inhibitors, in carefully selected patients and exploitation of expression changes of the target before and after manipulation is anticipated to increase the existing data and facilitate therapeutic decision making at this late stage of the disease when hormonal manipulations, even with the newest androgen-directed therapies are no longer feasible.},

Self-renewing naive mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) contain few mitochondria, which increase in number and volume at the onset of differentiation. KBP (encoded by Kif1bp) is an interactor of the mitochondrial-associated kinesin Kif1B$\alpha$. We found that TDH, responsible for mitochondrial production of acetyl-CoA in mESCs, and the acetyltransferase GCN5L1 cooperate to acetylate Lys501 in KBP, allowing its recognition by and degradation via Fbxo15, an F-box protein transcriptionally controlled by the pluripotency core factors and repressed following differentiation. Defects in KBP degradation in mESCs result in an unscheduled increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, enhanced respiration and ROS production, and inhibition of cell proliferation. Silencing of Kif1B$\alpha$ reverts the aberrant increase in mitochondria induced by KBP stabilization. Notably, following differentiation, Kif1bp−/− mESCs display impaired expansion of the mitochondrial mass and form smaller embryoid bodies. Thus, KBP proteolysis limits the accumulation of mitochondria in mESCs to preserve their optimal fitness, whereas KBP accumulation promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in differentiating cells.},

abstract = {The introduction of novel CTCF binding sites in gene regulatory regions in the rodent lineage is partly the effect of transposable element expansion. The exact mechanism and functional impact of evolutionarily novel CTCF binding sites are not yet fully understood. We investigated the impact of novel species-specific CTCF binding sites in two Mus genus subspecies, Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus castaneus, that diverged 0.5 million years ago. The activity of the B2-B4 family of transposable elements independently in both lineages leads to the proliferation of novel CTCF binding sites. A subset of evolutionarily young sites may harbour transcriptional functionality, as evidenced by the stability of their binding across multiple tissues in M. musculus domesticus (BL6), while overall the distance of species-specific CTCF binding to the nearest transcription start sites and/or topologically-associated domains (TADs) is largely similar to musculus-common CTCF sites. Remarkably, we discovered a recurrent regulatory architecture consisting of a CTCF binding site and an interferon gene that appears to have been tandemly duplicated to create a 15-gene cluster on chromosome 4, thus forming a novel BL6 specific immune locus, in which CTCF may play a regulatory role.

abstract = {AIM To investigate the effect of orlistat on endothelial function in obese adolescents. METHODS Single-blind 10-week controlled trial of 67 normolipidaemic obese adolescents randomised into three groups. Group 1 (diet alone), Group 2 (diet and orlistat), Group 3 (diet, orlistat and exercise). Endothelial function measured by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, fasting blood lipids, insulin and glucose levels were recorded at baseline and at 10 weeks. RESULTS Sixty four subjects completed the study. Groups were comparable at baseline. FMD increased significantly with orlistat (Groups 2 and 3) but not in Group 1. Orlistat treatment resulted in significantly reduced bodyweight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were unchanged. Triglyceride and insulin levels were significantly reduced in all three groups. The reduction in cholesterols did not correlate with reductions in weight and BMI. A slight reduction of body fat, both with and without orlistat treatment, correlated with reduction in BMI after adjustment for baseline values. Blood pressure was unaltered by orlistat. Calorie intake was reduced with orlistat, and the decrease noted in {\%} fat and increase in {\%} carbohydrate was significant only in those taking orlistat. The addition of exercise (Group 3 compared with Group 2) altered no parameter. CONCLUSIONS Orlistat improves endothelial function and reduces bodyweight, BMI, fasting total and LDL-cholesterol in obese adolescents when combined with dietary control. Improvement in endothelial function if maintained could reflect long-term cardiovascular benefit.},

abstract = {Metastasis is a phenomenon of crucial importance in defining prognosis in patients with cancer and is often responsible for cancer-related mortality. It is known that several steps are necessary for clonal cells to disseminate from their primary tumor site and colonize distant tissues, thus originating metastatic lesions. Therefore, investigating the molecular actors regulating this process may provide helpful insights in the development of efficient therapeutic responses. Recent evidences have indicated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating the metastatic process in solid tumors. miRNAs are small regulatory non-coding RNAs that bind to specific target mRNAs, leading to translational repression. miRNAs are known to act as negative regulators of gene expression and are involved in the regulation of biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, both in physiological conditions and during diseases, such as tumors. In the specific field of tumorigenesis, miRNAs play an important role in mediating oncogenesis and favoring tumor progression, as a result of their ability to modulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and other series of events facilitating the formation of metastasis. The role of miRNAs in cancer development has been widely studied and has helped elucidate events such as the change in expression of oncogenes, tumor-suppressors and cancer-related proteins. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying the role of miRNAs as part of the metastatic process. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cancer cells utilize lysosomes for invasion and metastasis. Myeloid Zinc Finger1 (MZF1) is an ErbB2-responsive transcription factor that promotes invasion of breast cancer cells via upregulation of lysosomal cathepsins B and L. Here we identify let-7 microRNA, a well-known tumor suppressor in breast cancer, as a direct negative regulator of MZF1. Analysis of primary breast cancer tissues reveals a gradual upregulation of MZF1 from normal breast epithelium to invasive ductal carcinoma and a negative correlation between several let-7 family members and MZF1 mRNA, suggesting that the inverse regulatory relationship between let-7 and MZF1 may play a role in the development of invasive breast cancer. Furthermore, we show that MZF1 regulates lysosome trafficking in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells. In line with this, MZF1 depletion or let-7 expression inhibits invasion-promoting anterograde trafficking of lysosomes and invasion of ErbB2-expressing MCF7 spheres. The results presented here link MZF1 and let-7 to lysosomal processes in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells that in non-cancerous cells have primarily been connected to the transcription factor EB. Identifying MZF1 and let-7 as regulators of lysosome distribution in invasive breast cancer cells, uncouples cancer-associated, invasion-promoting lysosomal alterations from normal lysosomal functions and thus opens up new possibilities for the therapeutic targeting of cancer lysosomes.},

abstract = {Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is a critical molecule for cellular responses to stimuli. In this study, we investigated whether RKIP is responsible for neural cell apoptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and explored the role of NF-$\kappa$B and ERK pathways regulated by RKIP under OGD stimuli. RKIP was overexpressed or knocked down using lentivirus in PC12 cells, which were then challenged by OGD. RKIP overexpression significantly increased the cell viability of OGD cells, and attenuated apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and reactive oxygen species generation. RKIP knockdown induced reverse effects. Moreover, we found that RKIP interacted with TAK1, NIK, IKK, and Raf-1 and negatively regulated the NF-$\kappa$B and ERK pathways. RKIP overexpression significantly inhibited IKK, I$\kappa$B$\alpha$, and P65 phosphorylation in NF-$\kappa$B pathway and MEK, ERK, and CREB phosphorylation in ERK pathway, respectively. RKIP knockdown induced reverse effects. Furthermore, a NF-$\kappa$B inhibitor BAY 11-7082 and a MEK inhibitor U0126 blocked the changes caused by RKIP down-regulation after OGD. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that RKIP plays a key role in neural cell apoptosis caused by OGD partly via regulating NF-$\kappa$B and ERK pathways. The present study may provide new insights into the role of RKIP in ischemic stroke.},

abstract = {The role of nitric oxide (NO) in cancer has been controversial and is based on the levels of NO and the responsiveness of the tumor type. It remains unclear whether NO can inhibit the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. EMT induction is mediated, in part, by the constitutive activation of the metastasis-inducer transcription factor, Snail and EMT can be inhibited by the metastasis-suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and E-cadherin. Snail is transcriptionally regulated by NF-$\kappa$B and in turn, Snail represses RKIP transcription. Hence, we hypothesized that high levels of NO, that inhibit NF-$\kappa$B activity, may also inhibit Snail and induce RKIP and leading to inhibition of EMT. We show that treatment of human prostate metastatic cell lines with the NO donor, DETANONOate, inhibits EMT and reverses both the mesenchymal phenotype and the cell invasive properties. Further, treatment with DETANONOate inhibits Snail expression and DNA-binding activity in parallel with the upregulation of RKIP and E-cadherin protein levels. The pivotal roles of Snail inhibition and RKIP induction in DETANONOate-mediated inhibition of EMT were corroborated by both Snail silencing by siRNA and by ectopic expression of RKIP. The in vitro findings were validated in vivo in mice bearing PC-3 xenografts and treated with DETANONOate. The present findings show, for the first time, the novel role of high subtoxic concentrations of NO in the inhibition of EMT. Thus, NO donors may exert therapeutic activities in the reversal of EMT and metastasis.},

abstract = {Ras proteins are guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that are highly conserved among eukaryotes. They are involved in signal transduction pathways and are tightly regulated by two sets of antagonistic proteins: GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inhibit Ras proteins, whereas guanine exchange factors activate them. In this work, we describe Tfs1p, the first physiological inhibitor of a Ras GAP, Ira2p, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TFS1 is a multicopy suppressor of the cdc25-1 mutation in yeast and corresponds to the so-called Ic CPY cytoplasmic inhibitor. Moreover, Tfs1p belongs to the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family, one member of which is RKIP, a kinase and serine protease inhibitor and a metastasis inhibitor in prostate cancer. In this work, the results of (i) a two-hybrid screen of a yeast genomic library, (ii) glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments, (iii) multicopy suppressor tests of cdc25-1 mutants, and (iv) stress resistance tests to evaluate the activation level of Ras demonstrate that Tfs1p interacts with and inhibits Ira2p. We further show that the conserved ligand-binding pocket of Tfs1-the hallmark of the PEBP family-is important for its inhibitory activity.},

Our results reveal additional specificity determinants for a large number of factors for which a partial specificity was known, including a commonly observed A- or T-rich stretch that flanks the core motifs.

RKIP has been implicated as a metastasis suppressor for prostate cancer, but the mechanism is not known. Here, we show that RKIP inhibits invasion by metastatic breast cancer cells and represses breast tumour cell intravasation and bone metastasis in an orthotopic murine model. The mechanism involves inhibition of MAPK, leading to decreased transcription of LIN28 by Myc. Suppression of LIN28 enables enhanced let-7 processing in breast cancer cells. Elevated let-7 expression inhibits HMGA2, a chromatin remodelling protein that activates pro-invasive and pro-metastatic genes, including Snail. LIN28 depletion and let-7 expression suppress bone metastasis, and LIN28 restores bone metastasis in mice bearing RKIP-expressing breast tumour cells. These results indicate that RKIP suppresses invasion and metastasis in part through a signalling cascade involving MAPK, Myc, LIN28, let-7, and downstream let-7 targets. RKIP regulation of two pluripotent stem cell genes, Myc and LIN28, highlights the importance of RKIP as a key metastasis suppressor and potential therapeutic agent.},

These disorders can largely be distinguished from one another by their associated clinical and neuroimaging features. The aim of this study was to define the phenotype that is associated with mutations in WDR45, a new causative gene for neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation located on the X chromosome. The study subjects consisted of WDR45 mutation-positive individuals identified after screening a large international cohort of patients with idiopathic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. Their records were reviewed, including longitudinal clinical, laboratory and imaging data. Twenty-three mutation-positive subjects were identified (20 females). The natural history of their disease was remarkably uniform: global developmental delay in childhood and further regression in early adulthood with progressive dystonia, parkinsonism and dementia. Common early comorbidities included seizures, spasticity and disordered sleep. The symptoms of parkinsonism improved with l-DOPA; however, nearly all patients experienced early motor fluctuations that quickly progressed to disabling dyskinesias, warranting discontinuation of l-DOPA. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed iron in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus, with a 'halo' of T1 hyperintense signal in the substantia nigra. All patients harboured de novo mutations in WDR45, encoding a beta-propeller protein postulated to play a role in autophagy. Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration, the only X-linked disorder of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, is associated with de novo mutations in WDR45 and is recognizable by a unique combination of clinical, natural history and neuroimaging features.},

Endogenous Rnd3 was targeted for knockdown using a doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA system in invasive human melanoma cells. Depletion of Rnd3 promoted prominent actin stress fibers and enlarged focal adhesions. Mechanistically, stress fiber formation induced by Rnd3 knockdown required the specific involvement of RhoA and ROCK1/2 activity but not RhoB or RhoC. Rnd3 expression in human melanoma cell lines was strongly associated with elevated extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and invasive behavior in a three-dimensional dermal-like environment. A functional role for Rnd3 was shown in the invasive outgrowth of melanoma tumor spheroids. Knockdown of Rnd3 reduced the invasive outgrowth of spheroids embedded in collagen gels. Additionally, Rnd3 depletion inhibited collective and border cell movement out from spheroids in a ROCK1/2-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings implicate Rnd3 as a major suppressor of RhoA-mediated actin cytoskeletal organization and in the acquisition of an invasive melanoma phenotype.},

The challenges associated with each step are highlighted. Next, we provide a practical guideline and a computational pipeline for DNase-seq data analysis by integrating some of these tools. We also discuss the competing techniques and the potential applications of this pipeline for the analysis of analogous experimental data.

abstract = {Background: CTCF binding contributes to the establishment of a higher-order genome structure by demarcating the boundaries of large-scale topologically associating domains (TADs). However, despite the importance and conservation of TADs, the role of CTCF binding in their evolution and stability remains elusive. Results: We carry out an experimental and computational study that exploits the natural genetic variation across five closely related species to assess how CTCF binding patterns stably fixed by evolution in each species contribute to the establishment and evolutionary dynamics of TAD boundaries. We perform CTCF ChIP-seq in multiple mouse species to create genome-wide binding profiles and associate them with TAD boundaries. Our analyses reveal that CTCF binding is maintained at TAD boundaries by a balance of selective constraints and dynamic evolutionary processes. Regardless of their conservation across species, CTCF binding sites at TAD boundaries are subject to stronger sequence and functional constraints compared to other CTCF sites. TAD boundaries frequently harbor dynamically evolving clusters containing both evolutionarily old and young CTCF sites as a result of the repeated acquisition of new species-specific sites close to conserved ones. The overwhelming majority of clustered CTCF sites colocalize with cohesin and are significantly closer to gene transcription start sites than nonclustered CTCF sites, suggesting that CTCF clusters particularly contribute to cohesin stabilization and transcriptional regulation. Conclusions: Dynamic conservation of CTCF site clusters is an apparently important feature of CTCF binding evolution that is critical to the functional stability of a higher-order chromatin structure.},

abstract = {Autophagy constitutes a prominent mechanism through which eukaryotic cells preserve homeostasis in baseline conditions and in response to perturbations of the intracellular or extracellular microenvironment. Autophagic responses can be relatively non-selective or target a specific subcellular compartment. At least in part, this depends on the balance between the availability of autophagic substrates ("offer") and the cellular need of autophagic products or functions for adaptation ("demand"). Irrespective of cargo specificity, adaptive autophagy relies on a panel of sensors that detect potentially dangerous cues and convert them into signals that are ultimately relayed to the autophagic machinery. Here, we summarize the molecular systems through which specific subcellular compartments-including the nucleus, mitochondria, plasma membrane, reticular apparatus, and cytosol-convert homeostatic perturbations into an increased offer of autophagic substrates or an accrued cellular demand for autophagic products or functions.},

Basal activity of ERK was enhanced in fat from nonobese mutant mice. Embryo fibroblasts from p62(-/-) mice differentiated better than the wild-type controls into adipocytes, which was abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of the ERK pathway. p62 is induced during adipocyte differentiation and inhibits ERK activation by direct interaction.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of CISD2 in glioma using the reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, coimmunoprecipitation assay, immunofluorescence staining and other methods. The results demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of CISD2 were found to be upregulated in glioma tissues, compared with the levels in matched normal tissues. Clinical data analysis showed that the level of CISD2 was negatively correlated with the survival rates of patients with glioma. In addition, high levels of CISD2 were associated with advanced clinical stage, relapse, vascular invasion and increased tumor size. The inhibition of CISD2 suppressed the proliferation and survival of glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, it was found that small interfering RNAinduced knock down of CISD2 inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells through activating beclin1mediated autophagy. The results also revealed that CISD2 was a target of microRNA (miR)449a. Together, the results of the present study demonstrated that CISD2 was increased in glioma samples and was associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior. The miR449a/CISD2/beclin1mediated autophagy regulatory network contributed to the proliferation of glioma cells. Targeting this pathway may be a promising strategy for glioma therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Several efforts have been focused on identification of pathways involved in malignancy, progression, and response to treatment in Glioblastoma (GB). Overexpression of PKC$\epsilon$ was detected in histological samples from GB, anaplastic astrocytoma, and gliosarcoma and is considered an important marker of negative disease outcome. In multiple studies on GB, autophagy has been shown as a survival mechanism during cellular stress, contributing to resistance against anti-cancer agents. The main object of this research was to determine the influence of PKC$\epsilon$ downregulation on the expression of genes involved in autophagy pathways in glioblastoma cell lines U-138 MG and U-118 MG with high PKC$\epsilon$ level. METHODS We conducted siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKC$\epsilon$ in glioblastoma cell lines and studied the effects of autophagy pathway. The expression of autophagy-related genes was analyzed using qPCR and Western blot analysis was carried out to assess protein levels. Immunostaining was used to detect functional autophagic maturation process. RESULTS We found that these cell lines exhibited a high basal expression of autophagy-related genes. Our results suggest that the loss of PKC$\epsilon$ contributes to the downregulation of genes involved in autophagy pathways. Moreover, most of the changes we observed in Western blot analysis and endogenous immunofluorescence experiments confirmed dysfunction of autophagy programs. We found that knockdown of PKC$\epsilon$ induced a decrease in the expression of Beclin1, Atg5, PI3K, whereas the expression of other autophagy-related proteins mTOR and Bcl2 was increased. Treatment of control siRNA glioma cells with rapamycin-induced autophagosome formation and increase in LC3-II level and caused a decrease in the expression of p62. Additionally, PKC$\epsilon$ siRNA caused a diminution in the Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 and in the protein level in both cell lines. Moreover, we observed reduction in the adhesion of glioblastoma cells, accompanied by the decrease in total FAK protein level and phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS Effects of down-regulation of PKC$\epsilon$ in glioma cells raised the possibility that the expression of PKC$\epsilon$ is essential for the autophagic signal transduction pathways in these cells. Thus, our results identify an important role of PKC$\epsilon$ in autophagy and may, more importantly, identifyit as a novel therapeutic target.},

abstract = {PPAR$\gamma$ promotes adipogenesis while Wnt proteins inhibit adipogenesis. However, the mechanisms that control expression of these positive and negative master regulators of adipogenesis remain incompletely understood. By genome-wide histone methylation profiling in preadipocytes, we find that among gene loci encoding adipogenesis regulators, histone methyltransferase (HMT) G9a-mediated repressive epigenetic mark H3K9me2 is selectively enriched on the entire PPAR$\gamma$ locus. H3K9me2 and G9a levels decrease during adipogenesis, which correlates inversely with induction of PPAR$\gamma$. Removal of H3K9me2 by G9a deletion enhances chromatin opening and binding of the early adipogenic transcription factor C/EBP$\beta$ to PPAR$\gamma$ promoter, which promotes PPAR$\gamma$ expression. Interestingly, G9a represses PPAR$\gamma$ expression in an HMT activity-dependent manner but facilitates Wnt10a expression independent of its enzymatic activity. Consistently, deletion of G9a or inhibiting G9a HMT activity promotes adipogenesis. Finally, deletion of G9a in mouse adipose tissues increases adipogenic gene expression and tissue weight. Thus, by inhibiting PPAR$\gamma$ expression and facilitating Wnt10a expression, G9a represses adipogenesis.},

However, the effects of autophagy are highly contextual, and autophagic cell death (ACD) is emerging as an alternative paradigm of (stress- and drug-induced) cell demise. AT 101 ([-]-gossypol), a natural compound from cotton seeds, induces ACD in glioma cells as confirmed here by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of ATG5 that partially, but significantly rescued cell survival following AT 101 treatment. Global proteomic analysis of AT 101-treated U87MG and U343 glioma cells revealed a robust decrease in mitochondrial protein clusters, whereas HMOX1 (heme oxygenase 1) was strongly upregulated. AT 101 rapidly triggered mitochondrial membrane depolarization, engulfment of mitochondria within autophagosomes and a significant reduction of mitochondrial mass and proteins that did not depend on the presence of BAX and BAK1. Conversely, AT 101-induced reduction of mitochondrial mass could be reversed by inhibiting autophagy with wortmannin, bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine. Silencing of HMOX1 and the mitophagy receptors BNIP3 (BCL2 interacting protein 3) and BNIP3L (BCL2 interacting protein 3 like) significantly attenuated AT 101-dependent mitophagy and cell death. Collectively, these data suggest that early mitochondrial dysfunction and HMOX1 overactivation synergize to trigger lethal mitophagy, which contributes to the cell killing effects of AT 101 in glioma cells.

abstract = {The relationship between 3D organization of the genome and gene-regulatory networks is poorly understood. Here, we examined long-range chromatin interactions genome-wide in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), iPSCs, and fibroblasts and uncovered a pluripotency-specific genome organization that is gradually reestablished during reprogramming. Our data confirm that long-range chromatin interactions are primarily associated with the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin, defining overall chromosome conformation. Additionally, we identified two further levels of genome organization in ESCs characterized by colocalization of regions with high pluripotency factor occupancy and strong enrichment for Polycomb proteins/H3K27me3, respectively. Underlining the independence of these networks and their functional relevance for genome organization, loss of the Polycomb protein Eed diminishes interactions between Polycomb-regulated regions without altering overarching chromosome conformation. Together, our data highlight a pluripotency-specific genome organization in which pluripotency factors such as Nanog and H3K27me3 occupy distinct nuclear spaces and reveal a role for cell-type-specific gene-regulatory networks in genome organization.

abstract = {MicroRNAs have been proved to participate in multiple biological processes in cancers. For developing resistance to cytotoxic drug, cancer cells, especially the cancer stem cells, usually change their microRNA expression profile to survive in hostile environments. In the present study, we found that expression of microRNA-27a was increased in colorectal cancer stem cells. High level of microRNA-27a was indicated to induce the resistance to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Knockdown of microRNA-27a resensitized colorectal cancer stem cells to TRAIL-induced cell death. Mechanically, the gene of Apaf-1, which is associated with the mitochondrial apoptosis, was demonstrated to be the target of microRNA-27a in colorectal cancer stem cells. Knockdown of microRNA-27a increased the expression level of Apaf-1, thus enhancing the formation of Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex and subsequently promoting the TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer stem cells. These findings suggested that knockdown of microRNA-27a in colorectal cancer stem cells by the specific antioligonucleotides was potential to reverse the chemoresistance to TRAIL. It may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating the colorectal cancer more effectively.},

abstract = {Many meta-analyses use a random-effects model to account for heterogeneity among study results, beyond the variation associated with fixed effects. A random-effects regression approach for the synthesis of 2 x 2 tables allows the inclusion of covariates that may explain heterogeneity. A simulation study found that the random-effects regression method performs well in the context of a meta-analysis of the efficacy of a vaccine for the prevention of tuberculosis, where certain factors are thought to modify vaccine efficacy. A smoothed estimator of the within-study variances produced less bias in the estimated regression coefficients. The method provided very good power for detecting a non-zero intercept term (representing overall treatment efficacy) but low power for detecting a weak covariate in a meta-analysis of 10 studies. We illustrate the model by exploring the relationship between vaccine efficacy and one factor thought to modify efficacy. The model also applies to the meta-analysis of continuous outcomes when covariates are present.},

abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of a modified p5 peptide, TFP5, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridine ion (MPP+)-induced neurotoxicity in cortical neurons and explore the therapeutic effect of TFP5 on Parkinson's disease (PD). MPP+ was applied to a primary culture of mouse cortical neurons to establish the cell model of PD. Neurons were divided into four groups: Control, model (MPP+), scrambled peptide (Scb) (Scb + MPP+) and TFP5 (TFP5 + MPP+) groups. Pretreatment with Scb or TFP5 was applied to the latter two groups, respectively, for 3 h, while phosphate-buffered saline was applied to the control and model groups. MPP+ was then applied to all groups, with the exception of the control group, and neurons were cultured for an additional 24 h. Neuron viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay. To explore the mechanism underlying the protective effects of TFP5, the expression levels of p35, p25 and phosphorylated myocyte enhancer factor 2 (p-MEF2D) were determined by western blotting. Fluorescence microscopy showed that TFP5 was able to pass through cell membranes and distribute around the nucleus. CCK8 assay showed that neuronal apoptosis was dependent on MPP+ concentration and exposure time. Cell viability decreased significantly in the model group compared with the control group (55+/-7 vs. 100+/-0{\%}; P{\textless}0.01), and increased significantly in the TFP5 group compared with the model group (98+/-2 vs. 55+/-5{\%}; P{\textless}0.01) and Scb group (98+/-2 vs. 54+/-4{\%}; P{\textless}0.01). Scb exhibited no protective effect. Western blotting results showed that MPP+ induced p25 and p-MEF2D expression, TFP5 and Scb did not affect MPP+-induced p25 expression, but TFP5 reduced MPP+-induced p-MEF2D expression. In summary, TFP5 protects against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in mouse cortical neurons, possibly through inhibiting the MPP+-induced formation and elevated kinase activity of a cyclin-dependent kinase 5/p25 complex.},

Although individual modifications have been linked to the activity levels of various genetic functional elements, their combinatorial patterns are still unresolved and their potential for systematic de novo genome annotation remains untapped. Here, we use a multivariate Hidden Markov Model to reveal 'chromatin states' in human T cells, based on recurrent and spatially coherent combinations of chromatin marks. We define 51 distinct chromatin states, including promoter-associated, transcription-associated, active intergenic, large-scale repressed and repeat-associated states. Each chromatin state shows specific enrichments in functional annotations, sequence motifs and specific experimentally observed characteristics, suggesting distinct biological roles. This approach provides a complementary functional annotation of the human genome that reveals the genome-wide locations of diverse classes of epigenetic function. {\textcopyright} 2010 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Elevated levels of the oncoprotein, osteopontin (OPN), are associated with poor outcome of several types of cancers including melanoma. We have previously reported an important involvement of DNAJB6, a member of heat-shock protein 40 (HSP40) family, in negatively impacting tumor growth. The current study was prompted by our observations reported here which revealed a reciprocal relationship between DNAJB6 and OPN in melanoma specimens. The 'J domain' is the most conserved domain of HSP40 family of proteins. Hence, we assessed the functional role of the J domain in activities of DNAJB6. We report that the J domain of DNAJB6 is involved in mediating OPN suppression. Deletion of the J domain renders DNAJB6 incapable of impeding malignancy and suppressing OPN. Our mechanistic investigations reveal that DNAJB6 binds HSPA8 (heat-shock cognate protein, HSC70) and causes dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3$\beta$ (GSK3$\beta$) at Ser 9 by recruiting protein phosphatase, PP2A. This dephosphorylation activates GSK3$\beta$, leading to degradation of $\beta$-catenin and subsequent loss of TCF/LEF (T cell factor1/lymphoid enhancer factor1) activity. Deletion of the J domain abrogates assembly of this multiprotein complex and renders GSK3$\beta$ inactive, thus, stabilizing $\beta$-catenin, a transcription co-activator for OPN expression. Our in-vitro and in-vivo functional analyses show that silencing OPN expression in the background of deletion of the J domain renders the resultant tumor cells less malignant despite the presence of stabilized $\beta$-catenin. Thus, we have uncovered a new mechanism for regulation of GSK3$\beta$ activity leading to inhibition of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling.},

abstract = {Autophagy is an intracellular, lysosomal-dependent process involved in the turnover of long-lived proteins, damaged organelles and other subcellular structures. The autophagic process is known to play an essential role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Results from recent studies also indicate an important role for the autophagic process in the pathogenesis of human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus and ageing. Because of the pivotal role of autophagy in the regulation of adipogenesis, obesity and insulin sensitization, research efforts have focused on elucidating the role of autophagy in metabolic syndrome. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cell growth and is characterized by a complex signalling mechanism that affects protein synthesis and autophagy. Results from experimental and clinical studies reveal some interesting, but conflicting, findings regarding the mTOR signalling pathway and autophagy in adipocytes in metabolic syndrome. Although the pivotal role of autophagy in obesity and other metabolic diseases has been established, its involvement in obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction remains unknown, as do the upstream signalling regulators of autophagy. The present minireview discusses the molecular mechanisms of autophagy in the regulation of cardiac function in overweight and obesity. Further studies using appropriate models are needed to better unravel the complex intracellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of autophagy in obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {HSD17B1 is a steroid metabolising enzyme. We have previously generated knockout mice that had the entire coding region of Hsd17b1 replaced with lacZ-neo cassette (Hsd17b1-LacZ/Neo mice). This resulted in a 90{\%} reduction of HSD17B1 activity, associated with severe subfertility in the knockout females. The present study indicates that Hsd17b1-LacZ/Neo male mice have a metabolic phenotype, including reduced adipose mass, increased lean mass and lipid accumulation in the liver. During the characterisation of this metabolic phenotype, it became evident that the expression of the Naglu gene, located closely upstream of Hsd17b1, was severely reduced in all tissues analysed. Similar results were obtained from Hsd17b1-LacZ mice after removing the neo cassette from the locus or by crossing the Hsd17b1-LacZ/Neo mice with transgenic mice constitutively expressing human HSD17B1. The deficiency of Naglu caused the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in all studied mouse models lacking the Hsd17b1 gene. The metabolic phenotypes of the Hsd17b1 knockout mouse models were recapitulated in Naglu knockout mice. Based on the data we propose that the Hsd17b1 gene includes a regulatory element controlling Naglu expression and the metabolic phenotype in mice lacking the Hsd17b1 genomic region is caused by the reduced expression of Naglu rather than the lack of Hsd17b1.},

abstract = {Metastasis is a great challenge in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) therapy. Cholesterol has been implicated in ADC metastasis. 4-cholesten-3-one, as cholesterol metabolite and analog, can substitute membrane cholesterol and increase membrane fluidity. In this study, we explored the possibility that 4-cholesten-3-one inhibited ADC metastasis. Low-dose 4-cholesten-3-one significantly restrained ADC cells migration and invasion with little effects on cells viabilities. Further investigation showed that 4-cholesten-3-one promoted ROS generation, which transiently activated AMPK$\alpha$1, increased HIF1$\alpha$ expression, reduced Bcl-2 expression and caused autophagy. AMPK$\alpha$1 knockdown partly suppressed 4-cholesten-3-one-induced autophagy but, neither prevented 4-cholesten-3-one-induced upregulation of HIF1$\alpha$ or downregulation of Bcl-2. 4-cholesten-3-one-induced autophagy facilitated the release of HMGB1 from nuclei to cytoplasm, blocking nuclear translocation of HIF1$\alpha$ and activation of MMP2 and MMP9. Also, 4-cholesten-3-one induced time-dependent phosphorylation of caveolin-1, Akt and NF-$\kappa$B. With increasing treatment time, 4-cholesten-3-one accelerated caveolin-1 internalization, but reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and NF-$\kappa$B, and inhibited the expression of snail and twist. These data suggested that 4-cholesten-3-one could be a potential candidate for anti-metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.},

Although fluoroquinolone antibiotics have also been found to have anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects, studies on the effect of GMF on treating colon cancer have been relatively rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the antimetastasis activities of GMF in colon cancer and the possible mechanisms involved. Results have shown that GMF inhibits the migration and invasion of colon cancer SW620 and LoVo cells and causes epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, GMF suppresses the activation of NF- $\kappa$ B and cell migration and invasion induced by TNF- $\alpha$ and inhibits the TAK1/TAB2 interaction, resulting in decreased I $\kappa$ B phosphorylation and NF- $\kappa$ B nuclear translocation in SW620 cells. Furthermore, Snail, a critical transcriptional factor of EMT, was downregulated after GMF treatment. Overexpression of Snail by cDNA transfection significantly decreases the inhibitory effect of GMF on EMT and cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, GMF may be a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of metastasis in colon cancer.},

abstract = {Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma(PPARgamma), a nuclear receptor and the target of anti-diabetic thiazolinedione drugs, is known as the master regulator of adipocyte biology. Although it regulates hundreds of adipocyte genes, PPARgamma binding to endogenous genes has rarely been demonstrated. Here, utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with whole genome tiling arrays, we identified 5299 genomic regions of PPARgamma binding in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The consensus PPARgamma/RXRalpha "DR-1"-binding motif was found at most of the sites, and ChIP for RXRalpha showed colocalization at nearly all locations tested. Bioinformatics analysis also revealed CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-binding motifs in the vicinity of most PPARgamma-binding sites, and genome-wide analysis of C/EBPalpha binding demonstrated that it localized to 3350 of the locations bound by PPARgamma. Importantly, most genes induced in adipogenesis were bound by both PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha, while very few were PPARgamma-specific. C/EBPbeta also plays a role at many of these genes, such that both C/EBPalpha and beta are required along with PPARgamma for robust adipocyte-specific gene expression. Thus, PPARgamma and C/EBP factors cooperatively orchestrate adipocyte biology by adjacent binding on an unanticipated scale.},

abstract = {A detailed understanding of the processes controlling adipogenesis is instrumental in the fight against the obesity epidemic. Adipogenesis is controlled by a transcriptional cascade composed of a large number of transcriptional factors, among which CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) $\beta$ plays an essential role. During 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, C/EBP$\beta$ is induced early to transactivate the expression of C/EBP$\alpha$ and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$), two master transcription factors for terminal adipocyte differentiation. Studies in recent years have revealed many new target genes of C/EBP$\beta$, implicating its participation in many other processes during adipogenesis, such as mitotic clonal expansion, epigenetic regulation, unfolded protein response, and autophagy. Moreover, the function of C/EBP$\beta$ is highly regulated by post-translational modifications, which are crucial for the proper activation of the adipogenic program. Advances toward elucidation of the function and roles of the post-translational modification of C/EBP$\beta$ during adipogenesis will greatly improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing adipogenesis.},

abstract = {We have reported the production of white adipocytes in adipose tissue from hematopoietic progenitors arising from bone marrow. However, technical challenges have hindered detection of this adipocyte population by certain other laboratories. These disparate results highlight the need for sensitive and definitive techniques to identify bone marrow progenitor (BMP)-derived adipocytes. In these studies we exploited new models and methods to enhance detection of this adipocyte population. Here we showed that confocal microscopy with spectrum acquisition could effectively identify green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive BMP-derived adipocytes by matching their fluorescence spectrum to that of native GFP. Likewise, imaging flow cytometry made it possible to visualize intact unilocular and multilocular GFP-positive BMP-derived adipocytes and distinguished them from non-fluorescent adipocytes and cell debris in the cytometer flow stream. We also devised a strategy to detect marker genes in flow-enriched adipocytes from which stromal cells were excluded. This technique also proved to be an efficient means for detecting genetically labeled adipocytes and should be applicable to models in which marker gene expression is low or absent. Finally, in vivo imaging of mice transplanted with BM from adipocyte-targeted luciferase donors showed a time-dependent increase in luciferase activity, with the bulk of luciferase activity confined to adipocytes rather than stromal cells. These results confirmed and extended our previous reports and provided proof-of-principle for sensitive techniques and models for detection and study of these unique cells.},

However, the requirements for IL-36R signal transduction remain poorly characterized. This work seeks to define the requirements for IL-36R signaling and intracellular trafficking. In the absence of cognate agonists, IL-36R was endocytosed and recycled to the plasma membrane. In the presence of IL-36, IL-36R increased accumulation in LAMP1+ lysosomes. Endocytosis predominantly used a clathrin-mediated pathway, and the accumulation of the IL-36R in lysosomes did not result in increased receptor turnover. The ubiquitin-binding Tollip protein contributed to IL-36R signaling and increased the accumulation of both subunits of the IL-36R.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy, is a catabolic process that results in the lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic contents ranging from abnormal proteins to damaged cell organelles. It is activated under diverse conditions, including nutrient deprivation and hypoxia. During autophagy, members of the core autophagy-related (ATG) family of proteins mediate membrane rearrangements, which lead to the engulfment and degradation of cytoplasmic cargo. Recently, the nuclear regulation of autophagy, especially by transcription factors and histone modifiers, has gained increased attention. These factors are not only involved in rapid responses to autophagic stimuli, but also regulate the long-term outcome of autophagy. Now there are more than 20 transcription factors that have been shown to be linked to the autophagic process. However, their interplay and timing appear enigmatic as several have been individually shown to act as major regulators of autophagy. This Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster highlights the main cellular regulators of transcription involved in mammalian autophagy and their target genes.},

Very few data exist regarding the effects of sibutramine on the mood of obese and overweight patients in general clinical samples. Moreover, no study has evaluated the effects of orlistat treatment on mood. The purpose of our study was to assess the effects of sibutramine and orlistat on mood in obese and overweight subjects. Methods and results: Sixty obese and overweight women were divided into three groups. The first group (n = 20) received a low-calorie diet and sibutramine 10 mg; the second group (n = 20) received a low-calorie diet and orlistat 120 mg three times a day, and the third group received only the low-calorie diet. Conclusion: A psychiatric assessment was performed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) before and after 3 months of treatment. In all the groups a statistically significant decrease in HAMD scores was observed. However, the decrease in the sibutramine group was greater compared to that observed in the two other groups (P {\textless} 0.01). These results suggest that sibutramine treatment may improve mood more than diet alone or orlistat therapy in a general clinical sample of obese patients. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Insulin resistance is a manifestation of both diabetes mellitus and obesity. However, the mechanism is still not clearly identified. Herein, we describe a procedure that allows us to evaluate the development of insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Under these conditions, we show that the concentration of insulin required for 50{\%} desensitization of glucose transport activity is 100 pM; maximal desensitization could be achieved with 1 nM. This demonstrates for the first time that 3T3-L1 adipocytes develop insulin resistance in response to physiologically relevant concentrations of insulin. Glucose (or glucosamine), in addition to insulin, was required to establish desensitization. The expression of GLUT4 protein decreased by 50{\%} with exposure to 10 nM insulin. The dose-dependent loss of GLUT4 was similar to the dose dependence for insulin-resistant transport activity. Translocation in the presence of acute insulin was apparent, but the extent of recruitment directly reflected the decrease in GLUT4 protein. GLUT4 mRNA also declined, but the ED50 was approximately 5 nM. Together, these data suggest that the loss of GLUT4 protein likely underlies the cause of desensitization. However, the loss of GLUT4 protein did not correlate with the loss in GLUT4 mRNA suggesting post-translational control of GLUT4 expression.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. Most differentiated cells convert glucose to pyruvate in the cytosol through glycolysis, followed by pyruvate oxidation in the mitochondria. These processes are linked by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), which is required for efficient mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. In contrast, proliferative cells, including many cancer and stem cells, perform glycolysis robustly but limit fractional mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation. We sought to understand the role this transition from glycolysis to pyruvate oxidation plays in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Loss of the MPC in Lgr5-EGFP-positive stem cells, or treatment of intestinal organoids with an MPC inhibitor, increases proliferation and expands the stem cell compartment. Similarly, genetic deletion of the MPC in Drosophila intestinal stem cells also increases proliferation, whereas MPC overexpression suppresses stem cell proliferation. These data demonstrate that limiting mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is necessary and sufficient to maintain the proliferation of intestinal stem cells.},

Early and late replication correlate, respectively, with open and closed three-dimensional chromatin compartments identified by high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and, to a lesser extent, late replication correlates with lamina-associated domains (LADs)4,5,8,9. Recent Hi-Cmapping hasunveiled substructure within chromatin compartments called topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely conserved in their positions between cell types and are similar in size to replication domains8,10. However, TADs can be further sub-stratified into smaller domains, challenging the significance of structures at any particular scale11,12.Moreover, attempts to reconcileTADs andLADs to replication-timing data have not revealed a common, underlying domain structure8,9,13. Here we localize boundaries of replication domains to the early-replicating border of replication-timing transitions andmap their positions in 18 human and 13mouse cell types. We demonstrate that, collectively, replication domain boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with TAD boundaries, whereas within a cell type, adjacentTADsthat replicate at similar times obscure replication domainboundaries, largely accounting for thepreviously reported lack of alignment. Moreover, cell-type-specific replication timing ofTADspartitions the genome into twolarge-scale sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and accounting for the reduced correlation of replication timing to LADs and heterochromatin. Our results reconcile cell-type-specific sub-nuclear compartmentalization and replication timingwith developmentally stable structural domains and offer a unified model for large-scale chromosome structure and function.},

As such, TOR has been identified as a key modulator of autophagy for more than a decade, and several deregulations of this pathway have been implicated in a variety of pathological disorders, including cancer. At the molecular level, autophagy regulates several survival or death signaling pathways that may decide the fate of cancer cells; however, the relationship between autophagy pathways and cancer are still nascent.

WAT comprises mainly white adipocytes that have a unique cellular structure in which almost the entire intracellular space is occupied by one single lipid droplet. The cytoplasm envelopes this lipid droplet and occupies negligible space. Differentiation of WAT, or adipogenesis, requires dramatic cytoplasmic reorganization, including a dynamic change in mitochondrial mass. Autophagy is a major cytoplasmic degradation pathway and a primary pathway for mitochondrial degradation. Recent studies indicate that autophagy is implicated in adipogenesis. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge on autophagy in adipose tissue biology, with the emphasis on its role in mitochondrial degradation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Rhinovirus (RV) infection in asthma induces varying degrees of airway inflammation (e.g. neutrophils), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. OBJECTIVE The major goal was to determine the role of genetic variation [e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] of Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) in airway epithelial responses to RV in a type 2 cytokine milieu. METHODS DNA from blood of asthmatic and normal subjects was genotyped for Tollip SNP rs5743899 AA, AG and GG genotypes. Human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells from donors without lung disease were cultured to determine pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses to IL-13 and RV16. Tollip knockout and wild-type mice were challenged with house dust mite (HDM) and infected with RV1B to determine lung inflammation and antiviral response. RESULTS Asthmatic subjects carrying the AG or GG genotype (AG/GG) compared with the AA genotype demonstrated greater airflow limitation. HTBE cells with AG/GG expressed less Tollip. Upon IL-13 and RV16 treatment, cells with AG/GG (vs. AA) produced more IL-8 and expressed less antiviral genes, which was coupled with increased NF-$\kappa$B activity and decreased expression of LC3, a hallmark of the autophagic pathway. Tollip co-localized and interacted with LC3. Inhibition of autophagy decreased antiviral genes in IL-13- and RV16-treated cells. Upon HDM and RV1B, Tollip knockout (vs. wild-type) mice demonstrated higher levels of lung neutrophilic inflammation and viral load, but lower levels of antiviral gene expression. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Our data suggest that Tollip SNP rs5743899 may predict varying airway response to RV infection in asthma.},

abstract = {The induction of autophagy usually requires the activation of PIK3C3/VPS34 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic subunit type 3) within a multiprotein complex that contains BECN1 (beclin 1, autophagy related). PIK3C3 catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol into phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). PtdIns3P associates with growing phagophores, which recruit components of the autophagic machinery, including the lipidated form of MAP1LC3B/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta). Depletion of BECN1, PIK3C3 or some of their interactors suppresses the formation of MAP1LC3B+ phagophores or autophagosomes elicited by most physiological stimuli, including saturated fatty acids. We observed that cis-unsaturated fatty acids stimulate the generation of cytosolic puncta containing lipidated MAP1LC3B as well as the autophagic turnover of long-lived proteins in the absence of PtdIns3P accumulation. In line with this notion, cis-unsaturated fatty acids require neither BECN1 nor PIK3C3 to stimulate the autophagic flux. Such a BECN1-independent autophagic response is phylogenetically conserved, manifesting in yeast, nematodes, mice and human cells. Importantly, MAP1LC3B+ puncta elicited by cis-unsaturated fatty acids colocalize with Golgi apparatus markers. Moreover, the structural and functional collapse of the Golgi apparatus induced by brefeldin A inhibits cis-unsaturated fatty acid-triggered autophagy. It is tempting to speculate that the well-established health-promoting effects of cis-unsaturated fatty acids are linked to their unusual capacity to stimulate noncanonical, BECN1-independent autophagic responses.},

abstract = {Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is a tumor suppressor and metastasis inhibitor, which enhances drug-induced apoptosis of cancer cells. Downregulation of RKIP may be significant in the biology of highly aggressive and drug-resistant tumors, for example triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Potential causes for the low levels of RKIP expressed by SUM 159 TNBC cells were investigated in the present study. Bisulphite modification, methylation specific-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a TransAM NF-kappaB assay were performed and the results suggested that various mechanisms, including methylation of the gene promoter, histone deacetylation and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, but not targeting by microRNA-224 (miR/miRNA-224), as determined by transfection of pre-miR-224 miRNA precursor or anti-miR-224 miRNA inhibitor, may downregulate RKIP in these cells. Furthermore, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, western blotting, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tet razolium cell growth assay and flow cytometry revealed that in SUM 159 cells, the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) and the NF-kappaB inhibitor dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ) enhanced RKIP expression and resulted in significant cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. 5-AZA and TSA mainly produced additive antitumor effects, while the combination of DHMEQ and TSA exhibited significant synergy in cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis assays. Increasing evidence that aberrant activation of NF-kappaB signaling is a frequent characteristic of TNBC highlights the fact that this transcription factor may be a useful target for treatment of such tumors. In addition to DHMEQ, proteasome inhibitors may also represent valuable therapeutic resources in this context. Notably, proteasome inhibitors, in addition to the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation, may also restore RKIP levels by inhibiting proteasome degradation of the ubiquitinated protein. The current results contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of RKIP downregulation in TNBC and suggest possible novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these types of cancer.},

abstract = {Purpose: Increasing evidence indicates that TGFbeta- and EGFR-signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of keratoacanthoma (KA) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin. We analyzed the expression pattern of TGFbeta-signaling components and screened for mutations in tgfbetaR1, egfr, kras and braf in KAs and SCCs. Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis of TGFbeta1, TGFbetaR1, TGFbetaR2 and phospho-SMAD2/3 was performed on skin tumors (29 KAs, 30 well and 31 moderately differentiated SCCs). Mutation screening in hotspot regions of tgfbetaR1, egfr, kras and braf was performed through pyrosequencing of tumor DNA. Findings: Expression of TGFbeta1, TGFbetaR1 and p-SMAD2/3 was increased in tumors as compared to surrounding skin. In KAs characteristic strong discontinuous membranous TGFbetaR1 expression pattern frequently associated with kras mutation was noted. SCCs showed continuous TGFbetaR1 expression, stronger p-SMAD2/3 expression and less frequent kras mutations. In tumors at sun-exposed sites stronger TGFbetaR1 expression was noted. One SCC showed tgfbetaR1 mutation, but no other mutations were found. Conclusion: Although tgfbetaR1 germline mutations cause inherited KAs and our finding of strong discontinuous membranous expression in KAs suggests accumulation of functionally altered protein, we found no tgfbetaR1 mutations or influence on TGFbeta-signaling, but frequent kras mutations in this subgroup of KAs. Characteristic TGFbetaR1 expression pattern in KA can facilitate histopathologic distinction from SCC.},

abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes a series of rapid changes in cellular phenotype. During EMT, epithelial cells down-modulate cell-cell adhesion structures, alter their polarity, reorganize their cytoskeleton, and become isolated, motile, and resistant to anoikis. The term EMT is often applied to distinct biological events as if it were a single conserved process, but in fact EMT-related processes can vary in intensity from a transient loss of cell polarity to the total cellular reprogramming, as found by transcriptional analysis. Based on clinical observations, it is more appropriate in most cases to describe the emergence of an EMT-like phenotype during tumor progression. Although EMT implies complete trans-differentiation, EMT-like emphasizes the intermediary phenotype associated with tumor cell renewal and adaptation to specific microenvironments. Here, we categorize the various EMT-like phenotypes found in human carcinomas that, depending on the tumor type, may or not represent analogous stages in tumor progression. We based these categories on the global tumor phenotype. The tumor microenvironment, which is associated with stromal reactions, hypoxia, paucity of nutrients, impaired differentiation, and activation of various EMT-associated pathways, modulates overall tumor phenotype and leads to tumor heterogeneity.

It is unknown whether these variants account for risk of IPF in other racial/ethnic populations. We conducted a candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study in cohorts of Mexican and Korean patients with IPF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We chose 12 SNPs from 11 loci that are associated with IPF among non-Hispanic whites and genotyped these SNPs in cohorts of Mexican (83 patients, 111 control subjects) and Korean (239 patients, 87 control subjects) people. Each SNP was tested for association with IPF, after adjusting for age and sex.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The MUC5B promoter SNP rs35705950 was associated with IPF in the Mexican (OR = 7.36, P = .0001), but not the Korean (P = .99) cohort. The SNP in IVD (chromosome15, rs2034650) was significantly associated with pulmonary fibrosis in both the Mexican (OR = 0.40, P = .01) and Korean (OR = 0.13, P = .0008) cohorts. In the Korean cohort, there were no other variants associated with disease. In the Mexican cohort, SNPs on chromosomes 3, 4, and 11 were also associated with disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The strongest identified genetic risk factor for IPF among the non-Hispanic white population, the MUC5B promoter polymorphism, is also a strong risk factor in a Mexican population, but is very rare in a Korean population. The majority of genetic variants that account for risk of IPF in groups other than non-Hispanic whites are unknown. Hispanic and Asian populations should be studied separately to identify genetic risk loci for IPF.},

We show here that, in HeLa cells, HCFC1 is observed bound to 5400 generally active CpG-island promoters. Examination of the DNA sequences underlying the HCFC1-binding sites revealed three sequence motifs associated with the binding of (1) ZNF143 and THAP11 (also known as Ronin), (2) GABP, and (3) YY1 sequence-specific transcription factors. Subsequent analysis revealed colocalization of HCFC1 with these four transcription factors at ∼90{\%} of the 5400 HCFC1-bound promoters.

Several well-established transcription factors regulate EMT and are conserved across tissue types and organ systems, including TWIST, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox (ZEB), and SNAIL-family members. Recent literature points to an important relationship between OPN and EMT, implicating OPN as a key regulatory component of EMT programs. In this review, OPN's interplay with traditional EMT activators, both directly and indirectly, will be discussed. Also, OPN's ability to restructure the tissue and tumor microenvironment to indirectly modify EMT will be reviewed. Together, these diverse pathways demonstrate that OPN is able to modulate EMT and provide new targets for directing therapeutics.},

In the present study, cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing activities of the Raf/ERK dual inhibitor CY-9d were found to be restricted in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells compared with ER/PR-positive cells. Based on the analysis of differentially expressed proteins using a quantitative proteomic iTRAQ method and bioinformatics analysis, HSP90 was found to identify as a potential mediator between Raf and ERK in TNBC cells. Western blotting and RNA interference suggested that down-regulated IQGAP1 can attenuate the routine Raf/MEK/ERK cascade and recruit HSP90 as a bypass pathway. Simultaneous treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor and CY-9d at sub-therapeutic doses was found to produce synergistic therapeutic and apoptosis-inducing effects in TNBC cells. Moreover, CY-9d was also found to suppress breast cancer growth, inhibit the activation of Raf/ERK, and induce mitochondrial apoptosis in vivo without remarkable toxicity. These results support the combination of HSP90 and Raf/ERK inhibitors as a potential target therapeutic strategy with enhanced tumor growth suppression, downstream pathway blockade, and greater induction of apoptosis.},

AEG-1 induces noncanonical autophagy involving an increase in expression of ATG5. AEG-1 decreases the ATP/AMP ratio, resulting in diminished cellular metabolism and activation of AMP kinase, which induces AMPK/mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent autophagy. Inhibition of AMPK by siAMPK or compound C decreases expression of ATG5, ultimately attenuating AEG-1-induced autophagy. AEG-1 protects normal cells from serum starvation-induced death through protective autophagy, and inhibition of AEG-1-induced autophagy results in serum starvation-induced cell death. We also show that AEG-1-mediated chemoresistance is because of protective autophagy and inhibition of AEG-1 results in a decrease in protective autophagy and chemosensitization of cancer cells. In summary, the present study reveals a previously unknown aspect of AEG-1 function by identifying it as a potential regulator of protective autophagy, an important feature of AEG-1 that may contribute to its tumor-promoting properties.},

Here we assessed the role of ESRP1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using anti-ESRP1, FGFR-2 IIIb and FGFR-2 IIIc antibodies in 123 PDAC cases. ESRP1 expression vector and small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting ESRP1 were transfected into human PDAC cells, and cell growth, migration and invasion were analyzed. In vivo heterotopic and orthotopic implantations using ESRP1 overexpression clones were performed and effects on pancreatic tumor volumes and hepatic and pulmonary metastases determined. ESRP1 immunoreactivity was strong in the nuclei of cancer cells in well-to-moderately differentiated PDACs but weak in poorly differentiated cancers. Well-to-moderately differentiated cancers also exhibited high FGFR-2 IIIb and low FGFR-2 IIIc expression, whereas this ratio was reversed in the poorly differentiated cancers. Increased ESRP1 expression was associated with longer survival in comparison with low ESRP1 expression, and PANC-1 cells engineered to express ESRP1 exhibited increased FGFR-2 IIIb expression and decreased migration and invasion in vitro, whereas ESRP1 siRNA-transfected KLM-1 cells exhibited increased FGFR-2 IIIc expression and increased cell growth, migration and invasion. In vivo, ESRP1-overexpressing clones formed significantly fewer liver metastases as compared with control clones. ESRP1 regulates the expression pattern of FGFR-2 isoforms, attenuates cell growth, migration, invasion and metastasis, and is a favorable prognostic factor in PDAC. Therefore, devising mechanisms to upregulate ESRP1 may exert a beneficial therapeutic effect in PDAC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND It is thought that genes with similar patterns of mRNA expression and genes with similar functions are likely to be regulated via the same mechanisms. It has been difficult to quantitatively test these hypotheses on a large scale because there has been no general way of determining whether genes share a common regulatory mechanism. Here we use data from a recent genome wide binding analysis in combination with mRNA expression data and existing functional annotations to quantify the likelihood that genes with varying degrees of similarity in mRNA expression profile or function will be bound by a common transcription factor. RESULTS Genes with strongly correlated mRNA expression profiles are more likely to have their promoter regions bound by a common transcription factor. This effect is present only at relatively high levels of expression similarity. In order for two genes to have a greater than 50{\%} chance of sharing a common transcription factor binder, the correlation between their expression profiles (across the 611 microarrays used in our study) must be greater than 0.84. Genes with similar functional annotations are also more likely to be bound by a common transcription factor. Combining mRNA expression data with functional annotation results in a better predictive model than using either data source alone. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate how mRNA expression data and functional annotations can be used together to estimate the probability that genes share a common regulatory mechanism. Existing microarray data and known functional annotations are sufficient to identify only a relatively small percentage of co-regulated genes.},

During the last decade, many systems biological approaches that base on genome-wide data have been developed to unravel the complexity of gene regulation. This review deals with the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from experimental data through computational methods. Standard GRN inference methods primarily use gene expression data derived from microarrays. However, the incorporation of additional information from heterogeneous data sources, e.g. genome sequence and protein-DNA interaction data, clearly supports the network inference process. This review focuses on promising modelling approaches that use such diverse types of molecular biological information. In particular, approaches are discussed that enable the modelling of the dynamics of gene regulatory systems. The review provides an overview of common modelling schemes and learning algorithms and outlines current challenges in GRN modelling. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {This study examined the synergetic effect of class IA Phosphoinositide 3-kinases catalytic subunit p110$\beta$ knockdown in conjunction with oxaliplatin treatment on colon cancer cells. Down-regulation of p110$\beta$ by siRNA interference and oxaliplatin treatment were applied in colon cancer cell lines HT29, SW620 and HCT116. MTT assay was used to measure the inhibitory effect of p110$\beta$ knockdown on the proliferation of colon cancer cell lines. SubG1 assay and Annexin-V FITC/PI double-labeling cytometry were applied to detect cell apoptosis. And cell cycle was evaluated by using PI staining and flow cytometry. The expression of caspase 3, cleaved PARP, p-Akt, T-Akt and p110$\beta$ was determined by western blotting. The results suggested that down-regulation of p110$\beta$ expression by siRNA obviously reduced cell number via accumulation in G 0 -G 1 phase of the cell cycle in the absence of notablely increased apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines HT29 and SW620 (S phase arrest in HCT116). Moreover, inhibition of p110$\beta$ expression increased oxaliplatin-induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HT29, HCT116 and SW620 cell lines. In addition, increases of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP induced by oxaliplatin treatment were determined by immunoblotting in p110$\beta$ knockdown group compared with normal control group and wild-type group. It is concluded that down-regulated expression of p110$\beta$ could inhibit colon cancer cells proliferation and result in increased chemosensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to oxaliplatin through augmentation of oxaliplatin-induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. {\textcopyright} Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

We recently identified myotubularin related protein-2 (Mtmr2), a phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatase, in the native Piezo2 interactome of murine dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Here, we demonstrate that Mtmr2 attenuates Piezo2-mediated rapidly adapting mechanically activated (RA-MA) currents. Interestingly, heterologous Piezo1 and other known MA current subtypes in DRG appeared largely unaffected by Mtmr2. Experiments with catalytically inactive Mtmr2, pharmacological blockers of PI(3,5)P2 synthesis, and osmotic stress suggest that Mtmr2-dependent Piezo2 inhibition involves depletion of PI(3,5)P2. Further, we identified a PI(3,5)P2 binding region in Piezo2, but not Piezo1, that confers sensitivity to Mtmr2 as indicated by functional analysis of a domain-swapped Piezo2 mutant. Altogether, our results propose local PI(3,5)P2 modulation via Mtmr2 in the vicinity of Piezo2 as a novel mechanism to dynamically control Piezo2-dependent mechanotransduction in peripheral sensory neurons.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Various studies have demonstrated that the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor in adipocytes can activate PI 3-kinase activity without affecting insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocation. To investigate this phenomenon of receptor signaling specificity, we utilized single cell analysis to determine the cellular distribution and signaling properties of PDGF and insulin in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes. The insulin receptor was highly expressed in a large percentage of the cell population ({\textgreater}95{\%}) that also expressed caveolin 2 and GLUT4 with very low levels of the PDGF receptor. In contrast, the PDGF receptor was only expressed in ∼10{\%} of the differentiated 3T3L1 cell population with relatively low levels of the insulin receptor, caveolin 2, and GLUT4. Consistent with this observation, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt in the caveolin 2- and GLUT4-positive cells, whereas PDGF primarily stimulated Akt phosphorylation in the caveolin 2- and GLUT4-negative cell population. Furthermore, transfection of the PDGF receptor in the insulin receptor-, GLUT4-, and caveolin 2-positive cells resulted in the ability of PDGF to stimulate GLUT4 translocation. These data demonstrate that differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes are not a homogeneous population of cells, and the lack of PDGF receptor expression in the GLUT4-positive cell population accounts for the inability of the endogenous PDGF receptor to activate GLUT4 translocation.},

PDGF receptor is expressed in a minor fraction of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. This minor fraction expresses low a mounts of insulin receptor, caveolin and GLUT4. PDGF receptors are not capable of coupling to GLUT4 translocation, unless over-expressed and were less effective than insulin anyways.

abstract = {Nuclear receptors comprise a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that play important roles in both physiology and diseases including cancer. The technologies of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by array hybridization (ChIP-chip) or massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been used to map, at an unprecedented rate, the in vivo genome-wide binding (cistrome) of nuclear receptors in both normal and cancer cells. We developed a curated database of 88 nuclear receptor cistrome data sets and other associated high-throughput data sets including 121 collaborating factor cistromes, 94 epigenomes, and 319 transcriptomes. Through integrative analysis of the curated nuclear receptor ChIP-chip/seq data sets, we discovered novel factor-specific noncanonical motifs that may have important regulatory roles. We also revealed a common feature of nuclear receptor pioneering factors to recognize relatively short and AT-rich motifs. Most nuclear receptors bind predominantly to introns and distal intergenetic regions, and binding sites closer to transcription start sites were found to be neither stronger nor more evolutionarily conserved. Interestingly, while most nuclear receptors appear to be predominantly transcriptional activators, our analysis suggests that the binding of ESR1, RARA, and RARG has both activating and repressive effects. Through meta-analysis of different omic data of the same cancer cell line model from multiple studies, we generated consensus cistrome and expression profiles. We further made probabilistic predictions of the nuclear receptor target genes by integrating cistrome and transcriptome data and validated the predictions using expression data from tumor samples. The final database, with comprehensive cistrome, epigenome, and transcriptome data sets and downstream analysis results, constitutes a valuable resource for the nuclear receptor and cancer community. {\textcopyright}2011 AACR.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy ('autophagy'), is the process by which cells can form a double-membraned vesicle that encapsulates material to be degraded by the lysosome. This can include complex structures such as damaged mitochondria, peroxisomes, protein aggregates and large swathes of cytoplasm that can not be processed efficiently by other means of degradation. Recycling of amino acids and lipids through autophagy allows the cell to form intracellular pools that aid survival during periods of stress, including growth factor deprivation, amino acid starvation or a depleted oxygen supply. One of the major functions of autophagy that has emerged over the last decade is its importance as a safeguard against infection. The ability of autophagy to selectively target intracellular pathogens for destruction is now regarded as a key aspect of the innate immune response. However, pathogens have evolved mechanisms to either evade or reconfigure the autophagy pathway for their own survival. Understanding how pathogens interact with and manipulate the host autophagy pathway will hopefully provide a basis for combating infection and increase our understanding of the role and regulation of autophagy. Herein, we will discuss how the host cell can identify and target invading pathogens and how pathogens have adapted in order to evade destruction by the host cell. In particular, we will focus on interactions between the mammalian autophagy gene 8 (ATG8) proteins and the host and pathogen effector proteins.},

To identify MEOX2 binding proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart cDNA library was performed using a deleted MEOX2 bait protein that does not contain the histidine/glutamine rich region (MEOX2deltaHQ). Eleven putative interacting proteins were identified including RING finger protein 10 (RNF10). In vitro pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation studies in mammalian cells further supported the yeast data demonstrating RNF10 bound to MEOX2. The minimal RNF10 binding region of MEOX2 was determined to be a central region between the histidine/glutamine rich domain and the homeodomain (amino acids 101-185). The amino terminal region of RNF10, containing the RING finger domain, was not essential for the binding to MEOX2. Our results also demonstrated that MEOX2 activation of the p21WAF1 promoter was enhanced by RNF10 co-expression.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). As oxygen is essential for many metabolic pathways, tumour hypoxia may impair cancer cell proliferation 1-4 . However, the limiting metabolites for proliferation under hypoxia and in tumours are unknown. Here, we assessed proliferation of a collection of cancer cells following inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), a major metabolic pathway requiring molecular oxygen 5 . Sensitivity to ETC inhibition varied across cell lines, and subsequent metabolomic analysis uncovered aspartate availability as a major determinant of sensitivity. Cell lines least sensitive to ETC inhibition maintain aspartate levels by importing it through an aspartate/glutamate transporter, SLC1A3. Genetic or pharmacologic modulation of SLC1A3 activity markedly altered cancer cell sensitivity to ETC inhibitors. Interestingly, aspartate levels also decrease under low oxygen, and increasing aspartate import by SLC1A3 provides a competitive advantage to cancer cells at low oxygen levels and in tumour xenografts. Finally, aspartate levels in primary human tumours negatively correlate with the expression of hypoxia markers, suggesting that tumour hypoxia is sufficient to inhibit ETC and, consequently, aspartate synthesis in vivo. Therefore, aspartate may be a limiting metabolite for tumour growth, and aspartate availability could be targeted for cancer therapy.},

It is characterised by focal areas of increased and disorganised bone turnover, coupled with increased bone formation. This disease usually appears in the late stages of life, being slightly more frequent in men than in women. It has been reported worldwide, but primarily affects individuals of British descent. Majority of PDB patients are asymptomatic, but clinical manifestations include pain, bone deformity and complications, like pathological fractures and deafness. The causes of the disease are poorly understood and it is considered as a complex trait, combining genetic predisposition with environmental factors. Linkage analysis identified SQSTM1, at chromosome 5q35, as directly related to the disease. A number of mutations in this gene have been reported, pP392L being the most common variant among different populations. Most of these variants affect the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of the protein, which is involved in autophagy processes. Genome-wide association studies enlarged the number of loci associated with PDB, and further fine-mapping studies, combined with functional analysis, identified OPTN and RIN3 as causal genes for Paget's disease. A combination of risk alleles identified by genome-wide association studies led to the development of a score to predict disease severity, which could improve the management of the disease. Further studies need to be conducted to elucidate other important aspects of the trait, such as its focal nature and the epidemiological changes found in some populations. In this review, we summarize the clinical characteristics of the disease and the latest genetic advances to identify susceptibility genes. We also list current available treatments and prospective options.},

abstract = {Comments on an article "Long-term drug treatment for obesity: A systematic and clinical review" by S. Z. Yanovski and J. A. Yanovski (2014). The review by Dr Yanovski and Dr Yanovski on the treatment of obesity focused on drugs currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for long term treatment, which includes orlistat, phenterminetopiramate, and lorcaserin. The discussion of the mechanisms of action of the latter 2 drugs was limited to their appetite suppressive effects. However, these medications also have major psychotropic properties. Phentermine is structurally and functionally similar to dexamphetamine, with similar clinical effects on mood and motivation.Topiramate can lead to mood changes, including improvement or worsening of depression. Lorcaserin reduces impulsive responses. Future research should consider all the clinical effects of these drugs, with the aim of titrating the dose to maximize their therapeutic potential.

Insulin resistance can be induced in cultured adipocytes by a variety of treatments, but what aspects of the invivo responses are captured by these models remains unknown. We use global RNA sequencing to investigate changes induced by TNF-$\alpha$, hypoxia, dexamethasone, high insulin, and a combination of TNF-$\alpha$ and hypoxia, comparing the results to the changes in white adipose tissue from DIO mice. We found that different invitro models capture distinct features of DIO adipose insulin resistance, and a combined treatment of TNF-$\alpha$ and hypoxia is most able to mimic the invivo changes. Using genome-wide DNase I hypersensitivity followed by sequencing, we further examined the transcriptional regulation of TNF-$\alpha$-induced insulin resistance, and we found that C/EPB$\beta$ is a potential key regulator of adipose insulin resistance},

Over the last decades, increasing evidence of a dynamic collaborative interaction between these complexes through their shared interactions with cytoskeletal proteins and common signaling pathways has emerged not only as an important regulator of several aspects of epithelial cell behavior, but also as a coordinated adhesion module that senses and transmits signals from and to the epithelia surrounding microenvironment. The tight regulation of their crosstalk is particularly important during epithelial remodeling events that normally take place during morphogenesis and tissue repair, and when defective it leads to cell transformation and aggravated responses of the tumor microenvironment that contribute to tumorigenesis. In this review we highlight some of the interactions that regulate their crosstalk and how this could be implicated in regulating signals across epithelial tissues to sustain homeostasis.},

abstract = {Malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, has a high propensity for metastatic spread and is notoriously chemotherapy-resistant. Cordycepin, the active component of Cordyceps spp., has been identified to have anti-metastatic effect on tumor progression and thus possesses pharmacological and therapeutic potentials. However, the mechanisms of anti-metastatic effects of cordycepin at cellular levels remain elusive. We analyzed the effect of cordycepin on human melanoma miRNA expression profiles by miRNAarray and found that miR-33b was upregulated in highly-metastatic melanoma cell lines following cordycepin exposure. Cordycepin-mediated miR-33b expression was dependent on LXR-RXR heterodimer activation. miR-33b directly binds to HMGA2, Twist1 and ZEB1 3'-UTR to suppress their expression. The negative correlations between miR-33b levels and HMGA2, Twist1 or ZEB1 expression were detected in 72 patient melanoma tissue samples. By targeting HMGA2 and Twist1, miR-33b attenuated melanoma migration and invasiveness upon cordycepin exposure. miR-33b knockdown or ZEB1 overexpression reverted cordycepin-mediated mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), triggering the expression of N-cadherin. In spontaneous metastasis models, cordycepin suppressed tumor metastasis without altering primary tumor growth. We showed for the first time that targeting miRNA by cordycepin indicates a new mechanism of cordycepin-induced suppression of tumor metastasis and miR-33b/HMGA2/Twist1/ZEB1 axis plays critical roles in regulating melanoma dissemination.},

Mutations of excision repair cross‑complementation group 6 (ERCC6) and ERCC8 are predominantly responsible for CS, of which mutation of ERCC6 accounts for approximately two thirds of cases. The current report describes two siblings with severe neurologic abnormality and premature aging. Whole exome sequencing identified two novel mutations in ERCC6 that had not been previously reported. One was a nonsense mutation at codon 612 in exon 9 (c.1834C{\textgreater}T, p.Arg612Ter), and the other a missense mutation at codon 975 in exon 16 (c.2923C{\textgreater}T, p.Arg975Trp). Cosegregation analysis revealed c.1834C{\textgreater}T was paternal and c.2923C{\textgreater}T was maternal. A healthy baby with no mutated alleles was delivered based on prenatal diagnosis performed by genetic testing of amniocytes for the causative mutation. The present study will enrich the clinical and genetic spectrum of CS in China and world wide, and provides more evidence for future genotype‑phenotype studies.},

abstract = {Background: Follicular thyroid carcinoma's (FTC) often benign course is partially due to adjuvant radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment. However, once the tumour has spread and fails to retain RAI, the therapeutic options are limited and the outcome is poor. In this subset of patients, the identification of novel druggable biomarkers appears invaluable. Here, we investigated the stage dependent expression and functional role of the C-X-C chemokine receptors type 4 and 7 (CXCR4/7) in FTC. Methods: CXCR4/7 expression was examined in 44 FTC and corresponding non-neoplastic thyroid specimens as well as 10 FTC distant metastases and 18 follicular adenomas using tissue microarray technology. Expression levels were correlated with clinicopathological variables as well as overall and recurrence free survival. Changes regarding cell cycle activation, tumour cell invasiveness and mRNA expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were investigated after treatment with recombinant human SDF1$\alpha$/CXCL12 (rh-SDF1$\alpha$) and CXCR4 antagonists AMD3100 and WZ811. Results: CXCR4/7 expression was associated with large tumour size, advanced UICC stage as well as shorter overall and recurrence free survival. CXCR4 was significantly higher expressed in distant metastases than in primary tumour cores. In addition, rh-SDF1$\alpha$ induced invasive growth, cell cycle activation and EMT, while CXCR4 antagonists significantly reduced FTC invasiveness in vitro. Conclusion: Here we provide first evidence of the biological importance of the CXCR4/CXCR7/CXCL12 axis in FTC. Our findings underscore the therapeutic potential of this chemokine receptor family in advanced FTC and offer new valuable insight into the oncogenesis of metastatic FTC.},

abstract = {Approximately 50{\%} of melanomas require oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) signaling for proliferation, survival, and metastasis, and the use of highly selective B-RAF inhibitors has yielded remarkable, although short-term, clinical responses. Reactivation of signaling downstream of B-RAF is frequently associated with acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibitors, and the identification of B-RAF targets may therefore provide new strategies for managing melanoma. In this report, we applied whole-genome expression analyses to reveal that oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) regulates genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in normal cutaneous human melanocytes. Most prominent was the B-RAF-mediated transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, a keratinocyte-melanoma adhesion molecule whose loss is intimately associated with melanoma invasion and metastasis. Here we identify a link between oncogenic B-RAF, the transcriptional repressor Tbx3, and E-cadherin. We show that B-RAF(V600E) induces the expression of Tbx3, which potently represses E-cadherin expression in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Tbx3 expression is normally restricted to developmental embryonic tissues and promoting cell motility, but it is also aberrantly increased in various cancers and has been linked to tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We propose that this B-RAF/Tbx3/E-cadherin pathway has a critical role in promoting the metastasis of B-RAF-mutant melanomas.},

abstract = {Obesity causes insulin resistance, and PPAR$\gamma$ ligands such as rosiglitazone are insulin sensitizing, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. In C57BL/6 (B6) mice, obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) has major effects on visceral epididymal adipose tissue (eWAT). Here, we report that HFD-induced obesity in B6 mice also altered the activity of gene regulatory elements and genome-wide occupancy of PPAR$\gamma$. Rosiglitazone treatment restored insulin sensitivity in obese B6 mice, yet, surprisingly, had little effect on gene expression in eWAT. However, in subcutaneous inguinal fat (iWAT), rosiglitazone markedly induced molecular signatures of brown fat, including the key thermogenic gene Ucp1. Obesity-resistant 129S1/SvImJ mice (129 mice) displayed iWAT browning, even in the absence of rosiglitazone. The 129 Ucp1 locus had increased PPAR$\gamma$ binding and gene expression that were preserved in the iWAT of B6x129 F1-intercrossed mice, with an imbalance favoring the 129-derived alleles, demonstrating a cis-acting genetic difference. Thus, B6 mice have genetically defective Ucp1 expression in iWAT. However, when Ucp1 was activated by rosiglitazone, or by iWAT browning in cold-exposed or young mice, expression of the B6 version of Ucp1 was no longer defective relative to the 129 version, indicating epigenomic rescue. These results provide a framework for understanding how environmental influences like drugs can affect the epigenome and potentially rescue genetically determined disease phenotypes.},

Chemoresistance is defined by a complex network of factors including multi-drug resistance proteins, reduced cellular uptake of the drug, enhanced DNA repair, intracellular drug inactivation, and evasion of apoptosis. Pre-clinical models have demonstrated that many chemotherapy drugs, such as platinum-based agents, antracyclines, and taxanes, promote the activation of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway. NF-$\kappa$B is a key transcription factor, playing a role in the development and progression of cancer and chemoresistance through the activation of a multitude of mediators including anti-apoptotic genes. Consequently, NF-$\kappa$B has emerged as a promising anti-cancer target. Here, we describe the role of NF-$\kappa$B in cancer and in the development of resistance, particularly cisplatin. Additionally, the potential benefits and disadvantages of targeting NF-$\kappa$B signaling by pharmacological intervention will be addressed.},

The constructed networks approximate scale-free topology, but this is not universal across all datasets. We show strong positive correlations between gene connectivity within the whole network and gene essentiality as well as gene sequence conservation. We demonstrate the preservation of a modular structure of the networks formed, and demonstrate that, within some of these modules, it is possible to observe a strong correlation between connectivity and essentiality or between connectivity and conservation within the modules particularly within modules containing larger numbers of essential genes. CONCLUSION: Application of these techniques can allow a finer scale prediction of relative gene importance for a particular process within a group of similarly expressed genes.},

Although each TF displays highly conserved DNA binding preferences, most binding is species-specific, and aligned binding events present in all five species are rare. Regions near genes with expression levels that are dependent on a TF are often bound by the TF in multiple species yet show no enhanced DNA sequence constraint. Binding divergence between species can be largely explained by sequence changes to the bound motifs. Among the binding events lost in one lineage, only half are recovered by another binding event within 10 kilobases. Our results reveal large interspecies differences in transcriptional regulation and provide insight into regulatory evolution.},

Only 0.9{\%} of tumour buds were RKIP-positive. In the tumour centre, RKIP deficiency predicted metastatic disease (P=0.0307), vascular invasion (P=0.0506), tumour budding (P=0.0112) and an invasive border configuration (P=0.0084). Loss of RKIP correlated with NF-$\kappa$B activation (P=0.0002) and loss of E-Cadherin (P{\textless}0.0001). Absence of RKIP was more common in MMR-deficient cancers (P=0.0191), while no impact of KRAS and B-Raf mutation was observed.

abstract = {The authors previously identified plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) level as a quantitative lung injury biomarker in primary graft dysfunction (PGD). They hypothesized that plasma levels of PAI-1 used as a quantitative trait could facilitate discovery of genetic loci important in PGD pathogenesis. A two-stage cohort study was performed. In stage 1, they tested associations of loci with PAI-1 plasma level using linear modeling. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina CVD Bead Chip v2. Loci meeting a p {\textless} 5 x 10(-4) cutoff were carried forward and tested in stage 2 for association with PGD. Two hundred ninety-seven enrollees were evaluated in stage 1. Six loci, associated with PAI-1, were carried forward to stage 2 and evaluated in 728 patients. rs3168046 (Toll interacting protein [TOLLIP]) was significantly associated with PGD (p = 0.006). The increased risk of PGD for carrying at least one copy of this variant was 11.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 4.9-18.5{\%}). The false-positive rate for individuals with this genotype who did not have PGD was 6.1{\%}. Variants in the TOLLIP gene are associated with higher circulating PAI-1 plasma levels and validate for association with clinical PGD. A protein quantitative trait analysis for PGD risk prioritizes genetic variations in TOLLIP and supports a role for Toll-like receptors in PGD pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This Review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contributions to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging, with minimal side effects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a multifunctional DNA-binding transcription factor shown to be critical in a variety of biological processes, and its activity and function have been shown to be regulated by multitude of mechanisms, which include but are not limited to post-translational modifications (PTMs), its associated proteins and cellular localization. YY2, the paralog of YY1 in mouse and human, has been proposed to function redundantly or oppositely in a context-specific manner compared with YY1. Despite its functional importance, how YY2's DNA-binding activity and function are regulated, particularly by PTMs, remains completely unknown. Here we report the first PTM with functional characterization on YY2, namely lysine 247 monomethylation (K247me1), which was found to be dynamically regulated by SET7/9 and LSD1 both in vitro and in cultured cells. Functional study revealed that SET7/9-mediated YY2 methylation regulated its DNA-binding activity in vitro and in association with chromatin examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with sequencing (ChIP-seq) in cultured cells. Knockout of YY2, SET7/9 or LSD1 by CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats)/Cas9-mediated gene editing followed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that a subset of genes was positively regulated by YY2 and SET7/9, but negatively regulated by LSD1, which were enriched with genes involved in cell proliferation regulation. Importantly, YY2-regulated gene transcription, cell proliferation and tumor growth were dependent, at least partially, on YY2 K247 methylation. Finally, somatic mutations on YY2 found in cancer, which are in close proximity to K247, altered its methylation, DNA-binding activity and gene transcription it controls. Our findings revealed the first PTM with functional implications imposed on YY2 protein, and linked YY2 methylation with its biological functions.},

Here, we integrate comparative genomics with flux balance analysis to examine (i) the contribution of different genetic mechanisms to network growth in bacteria, (ii) the selective forces driving network evolution and (iii) the integration of new nodes into the network. Most changes to the metabolic network of Escherichia coli in the past 100 million years are due to horizontal gene transfer, with little contribution from gene duplicates. Networks grow by acquiring genes involved in the transport and catalysis of external nutrients, driven by adaptations to changing environments. Accordingly, horizontally transferred genes are integrated at the periphery of the network, whereas central parts remain evolutionarily stable. Genes encoding physiologically coupled reactions are often transferred together, frequently in operons. Thus, bacterial metabolic networks evolve by direct uptake of peripheral reactions in response to changed environments.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

Recently, lipid droplets (LDs) have been identified as a substrate for macroautophagy. In addition to the classic pathway of lipid metabolism by cytosolic lipases, LDs are sequestered in autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes for the breakdown of LD components by lysosomal enzymes. The ability of autophagy to respond to changes in nutrient supply allows the cell to alter LD metabolism to meet the cell's energy demands. Pathophysiological changes in autophagic function can alter cellular lipid metabolism and promote disease states. Autophagy therefore represents a new cellular target for abnormalities in lipid metabolism and accumulation.},

abstract = {Adipogenesis is tightly controlled by a complex network of transcription factors acting at different stages of differentiation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family members are key regulators of this process. We have employed DNase I hypersensitive site analysis to investigate the genome-wide changes in chromatin structure that accompany the binding of adipogenic transcription factors. These analyses revealed a dramatic and dynamic modulation of the chromatin landscape during the first hours of adipocyte differentiation that coincides with cooperative binding of multiple early transcription factors (including glucocorticoid receptor, retinoid X receptor, Stat5a, C/EBP$\beta$ and -$\delta$) to transcription factor 'hotspots'. Our results demonstrate that C/EBP$\beta$ marks a large number of these transcription factor 'hotspots' before induction of differentiation and chromatin remodelling and is required for their establishment. Furthermore, a subset of early remodelled C/EBP-binding sites persists throughout differentiation and is later occupied by PPAR$\gamma$, indicating that early C/EBP family members, in addition to their well-established role in activation of PPAR$\gamma$ transcription, may act as pioneering factors for PPAR$\gamma$ binding.},

Resveratrol (RV) and vitamin E (vit E) (each at 0.2 and 2.0 µM) were applied simultaneously to explore the alleviation effect. The proteins in the cervical muscles of the day-1 chicks were analyzed using 2D-electrophoresis and LC/MS/MS. While the genomics associated with each specific protein alteration was examined with RT-PCR and qPCR. At earlier embryonic stage, VPA downregulated PEBP1 and BHMT genes and at the same time upregulated MYL1, ALB and FLNC genes significantly (p{\textless}0.05) without affecting PKM2 gene. Alternatively, VPA directly inhibited the folate-independent (or the betaine-dependent) remethylation pathway. These features were effectively alleviated by RV and vit E.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: VPA alters the expression of PEBP1, BHMT, MYL1, ALB and FLNC that are closely related with metabolic myopathies, myogenesis, albumin gene expression, and haemolytic anemia. On the other hand, VPA directly inhibits the betaine-dependent remethylation pathway. Taken together, VPA elicits hemorrhagic myoliposis via these action mechanisms, and RV and vit E are effective for alleviation of such adverse effects.},

abstract = {Various studies have demonstrated that the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor in adipocytes can activate PI 3-kinase activity without affecting insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocation. To investigate this phenomenon of receptor signaling specificity, we utilized single cell analysis to determine the cellular distribution and signaling properties of PDGF and insulin in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes. The insulin receptor was highly expressed in a large percentage of the cell population ({\textgreater}95{\%}) that also expressed caveolin 2 and GLUT4 with very low levels of the PDGF receptor. In contrast, the PDGF receptor was only expressed in ∼10{\%} of the differentiated 3T3L1 cell population with relatively low levels of the insulin receptor, caveolin 2, and GLUT4. Consistent with this observation, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt in the caveolin 2- and GLUT4-positive cells, whereas PDGF primarily stimulated Akt phosphorylation in the caveolin 2- and GLUT4-negative cell population. Furthermore, transfection of the PDGF receptor in the insulin receptor-, GLUT4-, and caveolin 2-positive cells resulted in the ability of PDGF to stimulate GLUT4 translocation. These data demonstrate that differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes are not a homogeneous population of cells, and the lack of PDGF receptor expression in the GLUT4-positive cell population accounts for the inability of the endogenous PDGF receptor to activate GLUT4 translocation.},

abstract = {Interpretation of high-throughput biological data requires a knowledge of the design principles underlying the networks that sustain cellular functions. Of particular importance is the genetic network, a set of genes that interact through directed transcriptional regulation. Genes that exert a regulatory role encode dedicated transcription factors (hereafter referred to as regulating proteins) that can bind to specific DNA control regions of regulated genes to activate or inhibit their transcription. Regulated genes may themselves act in a regulatory manner, in which case they participate in a causal pathway. Looping pathways form feedback circuits. Because a gene can have several connections, circuits and pathways may crosslink and thus represent connected components. We have created a graph of 909 genetically or biochemically established interactions among 491 yeast genes. The number of regulating proteins per regulated gene has a narrow distribution with an exponential decay. The number of regulated genes per regulating protein has a broader distribution with a decay resembling a power law. Assuming in computer-generated graphs that gene connections fulfill these distributions but are otherwise random, the local clustering of connections and the number of short feedback circuits are largely underestimated. This deviation from randomness probably reflects functional constraints that include biosynthetic cost, response delay and differentiative and homeostatic regulation.},

All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS 32 studies with 8281 patients were analyzed in total. The c-Met overexpression was related to poor OS (overall survival) (HR=1.65 (1.328, 2.051)) of 18 studies with 4751 patients and poor RFS/DFS (relapse/disease free survival) (HR=1.53 (1.20, 1.95)) of 12 studies with 3598 patients. Subgroup analysis according to data source/methods/ethnicity showed c-Met overexpression was related to worse OS and RFS/DFS in Given by author group, all methods group and non-Asian group respectively.

abstract = {Development of bone metastases is dependent on the cancer cell-bone cell interactions in the bone microenvironment. Transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) is released from bone during osteoclastic bone resorption and induces production of osteolytic factors, such as interleukin 11 (IL-11), in breast cancer cells. IL-11 in turn increases osteolysis by stimulating osteoclast function, launching a vicious cycle of cancer growth and bone destruction. We aimed to identify and functionally characterize microRNAs (miRNAs) that mediate the bone metastatic process, focusing on miRNAs that regulate the TGF-$\beta$ induction of IL-11. First, we profiled the expression of 455 miRNAs in a highly bone metastatic MDA-MB-231(SA) variant as compared to the parental MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and found 16 miRNAs (3.5{\%}) having a {\textgreater}3-fold expression difference between the two cell types. We then applied a cell-based overexpression screen with Pre-miRNA constructs to functionally identify miRNAs regulating TGF-$\beta$-induced IL-11 production. This analysis pinpointed miR-204, miR-211, and miR-379 as such key regulators. These miRNAs were shown to directly target IL11 by binding to its 3' UTR. MiR-379 also inhibited Smad2/3/4-mediated transcriptional activity. Gene expression analysis of miR-204 and miR-379-transfected cells indicated that these miRNAs downregulated the expression of several genes involved in TGF-$\beta$ signaling, including prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2). In addition, there was a significant correlation between the genes downregulated by miR-379 and a set of genes upregulated in basal subtype of breast cancer. Taken together, the functional evidence and clinical correlations imply novel mechanistic links between miRNAs and the key steps in the bone metastatic process in breast cancer, with potential clinical relevance.},

abstract = {Established as a potent anti-malaria medicine, artemisinin-based drugs have been suggested to have anti-tumour activity in some cancers. Although the mechanism is poorly understood, it has been suggested that artemisinin induces apoptotic cell death. Here, we show that the artemisinin analogue artesunate (ART) effectively induces cell death in RT4 schwannoma cells and human primary schwannoma cells. Interestingly, our data indicate for first time that the cell death induced by ART is largely dependent on necroptosis. ART appears to inhibit autophagy, which may also contribute to the cell death. Our data in human schwannoma cells show that ART can be combined with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) to potentiate the cell death. Thus, this study suggests that artemisinin-based drugs may be used in certain tumours where cells are necroptosis competent, and the drugs may act in synergy with apoptosis inducers or autophagy inhibitors to enhance their anti-tumour activity.},

abstract = {AIM: To investigate whether luteolin, a highly prevalent flavonoid, reverses the effects of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo and to determine the mechanisms underlying this reversal. METHODS: Murine malignant melanoma B16F10 cells were exposed to 1{\%} O(2) for 24 h. Cellular mobility and adhesion were assessed using Boyden chamber transwell assay and cell adhesion assay, respectively. EMT-related proteins, such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin, were examined using Western blotting. Female C57BL/6 mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were injected with B16F10 cells (1×10(6) cells in 0.2 mL per mouse) via the lateral tail vein. The mice were treated with luteolin (10 or 20 mg/kg, ip) daily for 23 d. On the 23rd day after tumor injection, the mice were sacrificed, and the lungs were collected, and metastatic foci in the lung surfaces were photographed. Tissue sections were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and HE staining. RESULTS: Hypoxia changed the morphology of B16F10 cells in vitro from the cobblestone-like to mesenchymal-like strips, which was accompanied by increased cellular adhesion and invasion. Luteolin (5-50 $\mu$mol/L) suppressed the hypoxia-induced changes in the cells in a dose-dependent manner. Hypoxia significantly decreased the expression of E-cadherin while increased the expression of N-cadherin in the cells (indicating the occurrence of EMT-like transformation), which was reversed by luteolin (5 $\mu$mol/L). In B16F10 cells, luteolin up-regulated E-cadherin at least partly via inhibiting the $\beta$3 integrin/FAK signal pathway. In experimental metastasis model mice, treatment with luteolin (10 or 20 mg/kg) reduced metastatic colonization in the lungs by 50{\%}. Furthermore, the treatment increased the expression of E-cadherin while reduced the expression of vimentin and $\beta$3 integrin in the tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: Luteolin inhibits the hypoxia-induced EMT in malignant melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of $\beta$3 integrin, suggesting that luteolin may be applied as a potential anticancer chemopreventative and chemotherapeutic agent.},

Overexpression of GFP/RFP-LC3/GABARAP is commonly used to monitor autophagosomes, a hallmark of autophagy, despite artifacts related to their overexpression. Here, we developed new sensors that detect endogenous LC3/GABARAP proteins at the autophagosome using an LC3-interacting region (LIR) and a short hydrophobic domain (HyD). Among HyD-LIR-GFP sensors harboring LIR motifs of 34 known LC3-binding proteins, HyD-LIR(TP)-GFP using the LIR motif from TP53INP2 allowed detection of all LC3/GABARAPs-positive autophagosomes. However, HyD-LIR(TP)-GFP preferentially localized to GABARAP/GABARAPL1-positive autophagosomes in a LIR-dependent manner. In contrast, HyD-LIR(Fy)-GFP using the LIR motif from FYCO1 specifically detected LC3A/B-positive autophagosomes. HyD-LIR(TP)-GFP and HyD-LIR(Fy)-GFP efficiently localized to autophagosomes in the presence of endogenous LC3/GABARAP levels and without affecting autophagic flux. Both sensors also efficiently localized to MitoTracker-positive damaged mitochondria upon mitophagy induction. HyD-LIR(TP)-GFP allowed live-imaging of dynamic autophagosomes upon autophagy induction. These novel autophagosome sensors can thus be widely used in autophagy research.},

Among them are gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphism, copy number variation, and protein-protein/gene-gene interactions. Each of these distinct data types provides a different, partly independent and complementary, view of the whole genome. However, understanding functions of genes, proteins, and other aspects of the genome requires more information than provided by each of the datasets. Integrating data from different sources is, therefore, an important part of current research in genomics and proteomics. Data integration also plays important roles in combining clinical, environmental, and demographic data with high-throughput genomic data. Nevertheless, the concept of data integration is not well defined in the literature and it may mean different things to different researchers. In this paper, we first propose a conceptual framework for integrating genetic, genomic, and proteomic data. The framework captures fundamental aspects of data integration and is developed taking the key steps in genetic, genomic, and proteomic data fusion. Secondly, we provide a review of some of the most commonly used current methods and approaches for combining genomic data with focus on the statistical aspects.},

The harvested adipose tissues are further digested to extract stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which is cultured, and the anchorage-dependent cells are isolated in order to characterize their stemness, surface markers, and multi-differentiation potential. The differentiation potential of ASCs is directed through manipulating culture medium composition with an introduction of growth factors to obtain the desired cell type. ASCs have been widely studied for its regenerative therapeutic solution to neurologic, skin, wound, muscle, bone, and other disorders. These therapeutic outcomes of ASCs are achieved possibly via autocrine and paracrine effects of their secretome comprising of cytokines, extracellular proteins and RNAs. Therefore, secretome-derivatives might offer huge advantages over cells through their synthesis and storage for long-term use. When considering the therapeutic significance and future prospects of ASCs, this review summarizes the recent developments made in harvesting, isolation, and characterization.

We demonstrate that NO significantly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation by inducing G0/G1 phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, compared to the control group, cells treated with SNP showed obviously higher apoptosis ratios in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we revealed that NO effectively inhibited the ability of migration and invasion of HepG2 cells.

abstract = {By capturing time-lapse images of primary stromal-vascular cells (SVCs) derived from rat mesenteric adipose tissue, we revealed temporal and spatial variations of lipid droplets (LDs) in individual SVCs during adipocyte differentiation. Numerous small LDs (a few micrometers in diameter) appeared in the perinuclear region at an early stage of differentiation; subsequently, several LDs grew to more than 10 mm in diameter and occupied the cytoplasm. We have developed a method for the fluorescence staining of LDs in living adipocytes. Time-lapse observation of the stained cells at higher magnification showed that nascent LDs (several 100 nm in diameter) grew into small LDs while moving from lamellipodia to the perinuclear region. We also found that adipocytes are capable of division and that they evenly distribute the LDs between two daughter cells. Immunofluorescence observations of LD-associated proteins revealed that such cell divisions of SVCs occurred even after LDs were coated with perilipin, suggesting that the "final" cell division during adipocyte differentiation occurs considerably later than that characterized in 3T3-L1 cells. Our time-lapse observations have provided a detailed account of the morphological changes that SVCs undergo during adipocyte division and differentiation.

abstract = {Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immune suppressive cells that are hallmarks of human cancer. MDSCs inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and NK cell functions to promote tumor immune escape and progression, and therefore are considered key targets in cancer immunotherapy. Recent studies determined a key role of the apoptosis pathways in tumor-induced MDSC homeostasis and it is known that ceramide plays a key role in regulation of mammalian cell apoptosis. In this study, we aimed to determine the efficacy and underlying molecular mechanism of ceramide in suppression of MDSCs. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with LCL521, a lysosomotropic inhibitor of acid ceramidase, significantly decreased MDSC accumulation in vivo. Using a MDSC-like myeloid cell model, we determined that LCL521 targets lysosomes and increases total cellular C16 ceramide level. Although MDSC-like cells have functional apoptosis pathways, LCL521-induced MDSC death occurs in an apoptosis- and necroptosis-independent mechanism. LCL521 treatment resulted in an increase in the number of autophagic vesicles, heterolysosomes and swollen ERs. Finally, concomitant inhibition of cathepsin B and cathepsin D was required to significantly decrease LCL521-induced cell death. Our observations indicate that LCL521 targets lysosomes to activate cathepsin B and cathepsin D, resulting in interrupted autophagy and ER stress that culminates in MDSC death. Therefore, a ceramidase inhibitor is potentially an effective adjunct therapeutic agent for suppression of MDSCs to enhance the efficacy of CTL-based cancer immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) comprise a large group of disorders of catabolism, mostly due to deficiency of a single glycan-cleaving hydrolase. The consequent endo-lysosomal accumulation of undigested or partially digested substrates in cells of virtually all organs, including the nervous system, is diagnostic of these diseases and underlies pathogenesis. A subgroup of LSDs, the glycosphingolipidoses, are caused by deficiency of glycosidases that process/degrade sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs are among the lipid constituents of mammalian membranes, where they orderly distribute and, together with a plethora of membrane proteins, contribute to the formation of discrete membrane microdomains or lipid rafts. The composition of intracellular membranes enclosing organelles reflects that at the plasma membrane (PM). Organelles have the tendencies to tether to one another and to the PM at specific membrane contact sites that, owing to their lipid and protein content, resemble PM lipid rafts. The focus of this review is on the MAMs, mitochondria associated ER membranes, sites of juxtaposition between ER and mitochondria that function as biological hubs for the exchange of molecules and ions, and control the functional status of the reciprocal organelles. We will focus on the lipid components of the MAMs, and highlight how failure to digest or process the sialylated GSL, GM1 ganglioside, in lysosomes alters the lipid conformation and functional properties of the MAMs and leads to neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson disease (PD). However, little is known about the regulation of autophagy in neurodegenerative process. In this study, we characterized aberrant activation of autophagy induced by neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and demonstrated that melatonin has a protective effect on neurotoxicity. We found an excessive activation of autophagy in monkey brain tissues and C6 cells, induced by MPTP, which is mediated by CDK5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5). MPTP treatment significantly reduced total dendritic length and dendritic complexity of cultured primary cortical neurons and melatonin could reverse this effect. Decreased TH (tyrosine hydroxylase)-positive cells and dendrites of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) were observed in MPTP-treated monkeys and mice. Along with decreased TH protein level, we observed an upregulation of CDK5 and enhanced autophagic activity in the striatum of mice with MPTP injection. These changes could be salvaged by melatonin treatment or knockdown of CDK5. Importantly, melatonin or knockdown of CDK5 reduced MPTP-induced SNCA/alpha-synuclein aggregation in mice, which is widely thought to trigger the pathogenesis of PD. Finally, melatonin or knockdown of CDK5 counteracted the PD phenotype in mice induced by MPTP. Our findings uncover a potent role of CDK5-mediated autophagy in the pathogenesis of PD, and suggest that control of autophagic pathways may provide an important clue for exploring potential target for novel therapeutics of PD.},

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

abstract = {For cancer cells to survive during extracellular matrix (ECM) detachment, they must inhibit anoikis and rectify metabolic deficiencies that cause non-apoptotic cell death. Previous studies in ECM-detached cells have linked non-apoptotic cell death to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, although the mechanistic underpinnings of this link remain poorly defined. Here, we uncover a role for receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) in the modulation of ROS and cell viability during ECM detachment. We find that RIPK1 activation during ECM detachment results in mitophagy induction through a mechanism dependent on the mitochondrial phosphatase PGAM5. As a consequence of mitophagy, ECM-detached cells experience diminished NADPH production in the mitochondria, and the subsequent elevation in ROS levels leads to non-apoptotic death. Furthermore, we find that antagonizing RIPK1/PGAM5 enhances tumour formation in vivo. Thus, RIPK1-mediated induction of mitophagy may be an efficacious target for therapeutics aimed at eliminating ECM-detached cancer cells.},

abstract = {The AP-5 adaptor protein complex is presumed to function in membrane traffic, but so far nothing is known about its pathway or its cargo. We have used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out the AP-5 $\zeta$ subunit gene, AP5Z1, in HeLa cells, and then analysed the phenotype by subcellular fractionation profiling and quantitative mass spectrometry. The retromer complex had an altered steady-state distribution in the knockout cells, and several Golgi proteins, including GOLIM4 and GOLM1, were depleted from vesicle-enriched fractions. Immunolocalisation showed that loss of AP-5 led to impaired retrieval of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR), GOLIM4, and GOLM1 from endosomes back to the Golgi region. Knocking down the retromer complex exacerbated this phenotype. Both the CIMPR and sortilin interacted with the AP-5–associated protein SPG15 in pull-down assays, and we propose that sortilin may act as a link between Golgi proteins and the AP-5/SPG11/SPG15 complex. Together, our findings suggest that AP-5 functions in a novel sorting step out of late endosomes, acting as a backup pathway for retromer. This provides a mechanistic explanation for why mutations in AP-5/SPG11/SPG15 cause cells to accumulate aberrant endolysosomes, and highlights the role of endosome/lysosome dysfunction in the pathology of hereditary spastic paraplegia and other neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {A recent slew of ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium publications, specifically the article signed by all Consortium members, put forward the idea that more than 80{\%} of the human genome is functional. This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is less than 10{\%}. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 - 10 = 70{\%} of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these "functional" regions or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly by employing the seldom used "causal role" definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, by committing a logical fallacy known as "affirming the consequent," by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between "junk DNA" and "garbage DNA," by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may well have to be rewritten.},

Based on the results obtained in the last decade, some miRNAs are emerging as biomarkers of BC for diagnosis (i.e., miR-9, miR-10b, and miR-17-5p), prognosis (i.e., miR-148a and miR-335), and prediction of therapeutic outcomes (i.e., miR-30c, miR-187, and miR-339-5p) and have important roles in the control of BC hallmark functions such as invasion, metastasis, proliferation, resting death, apoptosis, and genomic instability. Other miRNAs are of interest as new, easily accessible, affordable, non-invasive tools for the personalized management of patients with BC because they are circulating in body fluids (e.g., miR-155 and miR-210). In particular, circulating multiple miRNA profiles are showing better diagnostic and prognostic performance as well as better sensitivity than individual miRNAs in BC. New miRNA-based drugs are also promising therapy for BC (e.g., miR-9, miR-21, miR34a, miR145, and miR150), and other miRNAs are showing a fundamental role in modulation of the response to other non-miRNA treatments, being able to increase their efficacy (e.g., miR-21, miR34a, miR195, miR200c, and miR203 in combination with chemotherapy).},

Despite extensive research into the role of TETs in genome regulation, little is known about their effect on transposable elements (TEs), which make up nearly half of the mouse and human genomes. Epigenetic mechanisms controlling TEs have the potential to affect their mobility and to drive the co-adoption of TEs for the benefit of the host. We performed a detailed investigation of the role of TET enzymes in the regulation of TEs in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We find that TET1 and TET2 bind multiple TE classes that harbour a variety of epigenetic signatures indicative of different functional roles. TETs co-bind with pluripotency factors to enhancer-like TEs that interact with highly expressed genes in ESCs whose expression is partly maintained by TET2-mediated DNA demethylation. TETs and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are also strongly enriched at the 5′ UTR of full-length, evolutionarily young LINE-1 elements, a pattern that is conserved in human ESCs. TETs drive LINE-1 demethylation, but surprisingly, LINE-1s are kept repressed through additional TET-dependent activities. We find that the SIN3A co-repressive complex binds to LINE-1s, ensuring their repression in a TET1-dependent manner. Our data implicate TET enzymes in the evolutionary dynamics of TEs, both in the context of exaptation processes and of retrotransposition control. The dual role of TET action on LINE-1s may reflect the evolutionary battle between TEs and the host.},

If so, there are two consequences: first, both underexpression and overexpression of protein complex subunits should lower fitness, and second, the accuracy of transcriptional co-regulation of subunits should reflect the deleterious consequences of imbalance. Here we show that all these predictions are upheld in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This supports the hypothesis that dominance is a by-product of physiology and metabolism rather than the result of selection to mask the deleterious effects of mutations. Beyond this, single-gene duplication of protein subunits is expected to be harmful, as this, too, leads to imbalance. As then expected, we find that members of large gene families are rarely involved in complexes. The balance hypothesis therefore provides a single theoretical framework for understanding components both of dominance and of gene family size.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a chronic disease and a serious health problem that leads to increased prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and gallbladder disease., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of orlistat for weight loss and improved lipid profile compared to placebo in obese patients with hypercholesterolemia, treated over a period of 6 months., METHODOLOGY: In a 6-month, multicenter (10 centers in Portugal), double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study, 166 patients, aged 18-65 years, body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater} or = 27 kg/m2, LDL cholesterol {\textgreater} 155 mg/dl, were randomized to a reduced calorie diet (600 kcal/day deficit) plus orlistat three times a day or placebo. Exclusion criteria included triglycerides {\textgreater} 400 mg/dl, severe cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, type 1 or 2 diabetes under pharmacological treatment, and gastrointestinal or pancreatic disease., RESULTS: The mean difference in weight from baseline was 5.9{\%} (5.6 kg) in the orlistat group vs. 2.3{\%} (2.2 kg) in the placebo group. In the orlistat group 49{\%} of patients achieved 5-10{\%} weight loss and 8.8{\%} achieved {\textgreater} 10{\%}. The orlistat group showed a significant reduction in total and LDL cholesterol, with similar changes for HDL in both treatment groups. The frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events was slightly higher in the orlistat group than in the placebo group, leading to discontinuation in 7 patients., CONCLUSION: Treatment with orlistat plus a reduced calorie diet for 6 months achieved significant reductions in weight, BMI and lipid parameters.},

The lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) is a unique nuclear protein that utilizes flavin adenosine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor. Here we show that LSD1 epigenetically regulates energy-expenditure genes in adipocytes depending on the cellular FAD availability. We find that the loss of LSD1 function, either by short interfering RNA or by selective inhibitors in adipocytes, induces a number of regulators of energy expenditure and mitochondrial metabolism such as PPAR$\gamma$ coactivator-1$\alpha$ resulting in the activation of mitochondrial respiration. In the adipose tissues from mice on a high-fat diet, expression of LSD1-target genes is reduced, compared with that in tissues from mice on a normal diet, which can be reverted by suppressing LSD1 function. Our data suggest a novel mechanism where LSD1 regulates cellular energy balance through coupling with cellular FAD biosynthesis.},

abstract = {Constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B) has been linked with carcinogenesis and cancer progression, including metastasis, chemoresistance, and radiation resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms that result in constitutive activation of NF-$\kappa$B are poorly understood. Here we show that chronic expression of the pro-inflammatory protein tissue transglutaminase (TG2) reprograms the transcription regulatory network in epithelial cells via constitutive activation of NF-$\kappa$B. TG2-induced NF-$\kappa$B binds the functional NF-$\kappa$B binding site in hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1$\alpha$) promoter and results in its increased expression at transcription and protein levels even under normoxic conditions. TG2/NF-$\kappa$B-induced HIF-1 was deemed essential for increased expression of some transcription repressors, like Zeb1, Zeb2, Snail, and Twist. Unlike tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF$\alpha$), TG2 did not require I$\kappa$B kinase (IKK) for NF-$\kappa$B activation. Our data suggest that TG2 binds with I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ and results in its rapid degradation via a non-proteasomal pathway. Importantly, the catalytically inactive (C277S) mutant form of TG2 was as effective as was wild-type TG2 in activating NF-$\kappa$B and inducing HIF-1 expression. We also found that TG2 interacted with p65/RelA protein, both in the cytosolic and the nuclear compartment. The TG2/p65(NF-$\kappa$B) complex binds to the HIF-1 promoter and induced its transcriptional regulation. Inhibition of TG2 or p65/RelA also inhibited the HIF-1$\alpha$ expression and attenuated Zeb1, Zeb2, and Twist expression. To our knowledge, these findings show for the first time a direct link between TG2, NF-$\kappa$B, and HIF-1$\alpha$, demonstrating TG2's important role in cancer progression.},

abstract = {Prognostic and predictive factors are indispensable tools in the treatment of patients with neoplastic disease. For the most part, such factors rely on a few specific cell surface, histological, or gross pathologic features. Gene expression assays have the potential to supplement what were previously a few distinct features with many thousands of features. We have developed Bayesian regression models that provide predictive capability based on gene expression data derived from DNA microarray analysis of a series of primary breast cancer samples. These patterns have the capacity to discriminate breast tumors on the basis of estrogen receptor status and also on the categorized lymph node status. Importantly, we assess the utility and validity of such models in predicting the status of tumors in crossvalidation determinations. The practical value of such approaches relies on the ability not only to assess relative probabilities of clinical outcomes for future samples but also to provide an honest assessment of the uncertainties associated with such predictive classifications on the basis of the selection of gene subsets for each validation analysis. This latter point is of critical importance in the ability to apply these methodologies to clinical assessment of tumor phenotype.},

abstract = {Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a multisystem disorder with severe neurological symptoms. The majority of CS patients carry mutations in Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB), best known for its role in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Indeed, because various repair pathways are compromised in patient cells, CS is widely considered a genome instability syndrome. Here, we investigate the connection between the neuropathology of CS and dysregulation of gene expression. Transcriptome analysis of human fibroblasts revealed that even in the absence of DNA damage, CSB affects the expression of thousands of genes, many of which are neuronal genes. CSB is present in a significant subset of these genes, suggesting that regulation is direct, at the level of transcription. Importantly, reprogramming of CS fibroblasts to neuron-like cells is defective unless an exogenous CSB gene is introduced. Moreover, neuroblastoma cells from which CSB is depleted show defects in gene expression programs required for neuronal differentiation, and fail to differentiate and extend neurites. Likewise, neuron-like cells cannot be maintained without CSB. Finally, a number of disease symptoms may be explained by marked gene expression changes in the brain of patients with CS. Together, these data point to dysregulation of gene regulatory networks as a cause of the neurological symptoms in CS.},

abstract = {Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is exceptionally deadly because the tumors lack sensitive early-stage diagnostic biomarkers and are resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. Here, we investigated the role and mechanism of Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) in NSCLC radioresistance. The clinical data showed that the RKIP expression level was generally lower in radioresistant NSCLC tissues than in radiosensitive tissues. Reduced RKIP expression was related to NSCLC radioresistance and poor prognosis. In vitro experiments showed that RKIP knockdown increased radioresistance and metastatic ability in NSCLC cell lines. Mechanistically, RKIP reduction activated the Shh signaling pathway by derepressing Smoothened (Smo) and initiating glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli1)-mediated transcription in NSCLC. In addition, the inappropriately activated Shh-Gli1 signaling pathway then enhanced cancer stem cell (CSC) expression in the cell lines. The increasing quantity of CSCs in the tumor ultimately promotes the radiation resistance of NSCLC. Together, these results suggest that RKIP plays a vital role in radiation response and metastasis in NSCLC. RKIP reduction enhances radioresistance by activating the Shh signaling pathway and initiating functional CSCs. This role makes it a promising therapeutic target for improving the efficacy of NSCLC radiation treatment.},

Here, we showed that RKIP was downregulated in the NPC with high metastatic potentials, and its decrement correlated with NPC metastasis and poor patient survival, and was an independent predictor for reduced overall survival. With a combination of loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we observed that high expression of RKIP reduced invasion, metastasis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker alternations of NPC cells. We further showed that RKIP overexpression attenuated while RKIP knockdown enhanced Stat3 phosphorylation and activation in NPC cells; RKIP reduced Stat3 phosphorylation through interacting with Stat3; Stattic attenuated NPC cell migration, invasion and EMT marker alternations induced by RKIP knockdown, whereas Stat3 overexpression restored NPC cell migration, invasion and EMT marker alternations reduced by RKIP overexpression. In addition, there was an inverse correlation between RKIP and phospho-Stat3 expression in the NPC tissues and xenograft metastases. Our data demonstrate that RKIP is a metastatic suppressor and predictor for metastasis and prognosis in NPC, and RKIP downregulation promotes NPC invasion, metastasis and EMT by activating Stat3 signaling, suggesting that RKIP/Stat3 signaling could be used as a therapeutic target for NPC metastasis.},

Using one- and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, Western analysis, and mass spectrometry, we show that during paraptosis, alterations occur mainly in cytoskeletal proteins, signal transduction proteins, mitochondrial proteins, and some metabolic proteins. We also report the identification of: (1) a paraptosis inhibitor, phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (PEBP-1), and (2) a candidate mediator of paraptosis, prohibitin.

It is increasingly recognized that EMT is a dynamic process involving multiple intermediate or "hybrid" phenotypes rather than an "all-or-none" process. However, the role of EMT in various cancer hallmarks, including metastasis, is debated. Given the complexity of EMT regulation, computational modeling has proven to be an invaluable tool for cancer research, i.e., to resolve apparent conflicts in experimental data and to guide experiments by generating testable hypotheses. In this review, we provide an overview of computational modeling efforts that have been applied to regulation of EMT in the context of cancer progression and its associated tumor characteristics. Moreover, we identify possibilities to bridge different modeling approaches and point out outstanding questions in which computational modeling can contribute to advance our understanding of pathological EMT.},

abstract = {Class II/III PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases) produce the PtdIns(3)P lipid that is involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking. In contrast with class I PI3Ks, the potential signalling roles of class II/III PI3Ks are poorly understood. In a recent article in the Biochemical Journal, Bago and co-workers report that Vps34 (vacuolar protein sorting 34), the only class III PI3K, controls the activity of SGK3 (serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated protein kinase 3). Like other AGC kinases, the SGKs (SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3) are activated by dual phosphorylation. Unlike its cousins SGK1 and SGK2, SGK3 contains a PtdIns(3)P-binding domain, providing an additional element of regulation. The study by Bago et al. characterizes and makes extensive use of a Novartis Vps34 inhibitor (VPS34-IN1) that inhibits this PI3K isoform with nanomolar potency, without affecting other lipid kinases or more than 300 protein kinases. The authors show that this compound very rapidly reduced PtdIns(3)P levels at the endosome with concomitant loss of SGK3 phosphorylation. Co-inhibition of class I PI3Ks led to a further reduction in SGK3 activity, indicating that class I PI3Ks may also regulate SGK3 activity through an additional, currently unknown, mechanism. It remains to be assessed whether the novel PI3K-protein kinase connection established by this study is subject to acute cellular stimulation or is part of a constitutive housekeeping function. VPS34-IN1 will provide a useful tool to decipher the kinase-dependent functions of Vps34, with acute changes in SGK3 phosphorylation and subcellular localization being new biomarkers of Vps34 activity.},

abstract = {FOXO1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) are crucial transcription factors that regulate glucose metabolism and insulin responsiveness in insulin target tissues. We have shown that, in primary rat adipocytes, both factors regulate transcription of the insulin-responsive GLUT4 gene and that PPARgamma2 detachment from the GLUT4 promoter upon thiazolidinedione binding up-regulates GLUT4 gene expression, thus increasing insulin sensitivity (Armoni, M., Kritz, N., Harel, C., Bar-Yoseph, F., Chen, H., Quon, M. J., and Karnieli, E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 30614-30623). However, the mechanisms regulating PPARgamma gene transcription are largely unknown. We studied the effects of FOXO1 on human PPARgamma gene expression in primary rat adipocytes and found that both genes are endogenously expressed. FOXO1 coexpression dose-dependently repressed transcription from either the PPARgamma 1 or PPARgamma2 promoter reporter by 65{\%}, whereas insulin (100 nm, 20-24 h) either partially or completely reversed this effect. Phosphorylation-defective FOXO1 mutants T24A, S256A, S319A, and T24A/S256A/S319A still repressed the PPARgamma1 promoter and partially lost their effects on the PPARgamma2 promoter in either basal or insulin-stimulated cells. Use of DNA binding-defective FOXO1 (H215R) indicated that this domain is crucial for FOXO1 repression of the PPARgamma2 (but not PPARgamma1) promoter. Progressive 5'-deletion and gel retardation analyses revealed that this repression involves direct and specific binding of FOXO1 to the PPARgamma2 promoter; chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that this binding occurs in cellulo. We suggest a novel paradigm to increase insulin sensitivity in adipocytes in which FOXO1 repression of PPARgamma, the latter being a repressor of the GLUT4 promoter, consequently leads to GLUT4 derepression/up-regulation, thus enhancing cellular insulin sensitivity. The newly identified FOXO1-binding site on the PPARgamma2 promoter may serve as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Metazoan genomes contain thousands of protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes, most of which are differentially expressed, i.e., at different locations, at different times during development, or in response to environmental signals. Differential gene expression is achieved through complex regulatory networks that are controlled in part by two types of trans-regulators: transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). TFs bind to cis-regulatory DNA elements that are often located in or near their target genes, while miRNAs hybridize to cis-regulatory RNA elements mostly located in the 3' untranslated region of their target mRNAs. Here, we describe how these trans-regulators interact with each other in the context of gene regulatory networks to coordinate gene expression at the genome-scale level, and discuss future challenges of integrating these networks with other types of functional networks.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a progressive developmental and neurodegenerative disorder resulting in premature death at childhood and cells derived from CS patients display DNA repair and transcriptional defects. CS is caused by mutations in csa and csb genes, and patients with csb mutation are more prevalent. A hallmark feature of CSB patients is neurodegeneration but the precise molecular cause for this defect remains enigmatic. Further, it is not clear whether the neurodegenerative condition is due to loss of CSB-mediated functions in adult neurogenesis. In this study, we examined the role of CSB in neurogenesis by using the human neural progenitor cells that have self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. In this model system, stable CSB knockdown dramatically reduced the differentiation potential of human neural progenitor cells revealing a key role for CSB in neurogenesis. Neurite outgrowth, a characteristic feature of differentiated neurons, was also greatly abolished in CSB-suppressed cells. In corroboration with this, expression of MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2), a crucial player in neuritogenesis, was also impaired in CSB-suppressed cells. Consistent with reduced MAP2 expression in CSB-depleted neural cells, tandem affinity purification and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed a potential role for CSB in the assembly of transcription complex on MAP2 promoter. Altogether, our data led us to conclude that CSB has a crucial role in coordinated regulation of transcription and chromatin remodeling activities that are required during neurogenesis.},

Tumor buds, defined as the presence of single tumor cells or small clusters of up to five tumor cells at the peritumoral invasive front (peritumoral buds) or within the main tumor body (intratumoral buds), are thought to represent the morphological correlate of cancer cells having undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an important mechanism for the progression of epithelial cancers. In contrast to their undisputed prognostic power and potential to influence clinical management, our current understanding of the biological background of tumor buds is less established. Most studies examining tumor buds have attempted to recapitulate findings of mechanistic EMT studies using immunohistochemical markers. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of studies examining protein expression profiles of tumor buds and to illustrate the molecular pathways and crosstalk involved in their formation and maintenance.},

abstract = {Objective Persistent inflammation and impaired adipogenesis are frequent features of obesity and underlie the development of its complications. However, the factors behind adipose tissue dysfunction are not completely understood. Previously it was shown that histone demethylase KDM1A is required for adipogenesis. Design and Methods Kdm1a expression was knocked down in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by siRNA transfection and whole-genome expression profiling was performed by microarray hybridization. The role of NF-?? and C/EBP? was analyzed by incubation with the inhibitor parthenolide and by cebpb knockdown, respectively. Results Knockdown of kdm1a or rcor2 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes results in impaired differentiation and induction of inflammatory gene expression. Enhanced expression of il6 in kdm1a knocked down preadipocytes is associated with increased recruitment of C/EBP? and the NF-?? subunit RelA to the il6 promoter. Cebpb knockdown attenuates the induction of il6 expression in kdm1a knocked down cells, whereas simultaneous cebpb knockdown and NF-?? inhibition abrogates it. Dietary-induced and genetic mouse models of obesity display decreased KDM1A in adipose tissue, and this correlates with increased expression of proinflammatory genes and C/EBP?. Conclusion KDM1A represses the expression of inflammatory genes in preadipocytes. Dysregulated kdm1a expression in preadipocytes may thus participate in the development of obesity-associated inflammation. Copyright ? 2013 The Obesity Society.},

abstract = {Even though real-time PCR has been broadly applied in biomedical sciences, data processing procedures for the analysis of quantitative real-time PCR are still lacking; specifically in the realm of appropriate statistical treatment. Confidence interval and statistical significance considerations are not explicit in many of the current data analysis approaches. Based on the standard curve method and other useful data analysis methods, we present and compare four statistical approaches and models for the analysis of real-time PCR data. In the first approach, a multiple regression analysis model was developed to derive $\Delta$$\Delta$Ct from estimation of interaction of gene and treatment effects. In the second approach, an ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) model was proposed, and the $\Delta$$\Delta$Ct can be derived from analysis of effects of variables. The other two models involve calculation $\Delta$Ct followed by a two group t- test and non-parametric analogous Wilcoxon test. SAS programs were developed for all four models and data output for analysis of a sample set are presented. In addition, a data quality control model was developed and implemented using SAS. Practical statistical solutions with SAS programs were developed for real-time PCR data and a sample dataset was analyzed with the SAS programs. The analysis using the various models and programs yielded similar results. Data quality control and analysis procedures presented here provide statistical elements for the estimation of the relative expression of genes using real-time PCR.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently accumulated evidence suggests that Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) participates in regulation of many signaling pathways and plays an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis. However, studies investigating the role of RKIP in colorectal cancer have not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of RKIP on colorectal cancer cell differentiation, progression and its correlation with chemosensitivity. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that RKIP expression was higher in non-neoplastic colorectal tissue (NCRCT) and colorectal cancer tissue (CRCT) than that in metastatic lymph node tissue (MLNT) (P {\textless}0.05). P-ERK protein expression was higher in MLNT and CRCT than that in NCRCT (P = 0.02). Immunocytochemical analysis further revealed that RKIP expression was higher in the well differentiated cell line SW1116 as compared to that in the poorly differentiated cell line LoVo. Matrigel invasive assay demonstrated that the inhibition of RKIP by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) 271 transfection significantly increased the number of migrated cells (90.67 ± 4.04 vs. 37.33 ± 2.51, P {\textless}0.05), whereas over-expression of RKIP by PEBP-1 plasmid transfection significantly suppressed the number of migrated cells (79.24 ± 5.18 vs. 154.33 ± 7.25, P {\textless}0.05). Meanwhile, down-regulation of RKIP induced an increase in the cell survival rate by inhibiting apoptosis induced by hydroxycamptothecine. CONCLUSIONS: RKIP was also found to be associated with cell differentiation, with a higher activity in well differentiated colorectal cancer cells than in poorly differentiated ones. The upregulated expression of RKIP in colorectal cancer cells inhibited cell invasion and metastasis, while downregulation of RKIP reduced chemosensitivity by inhibiting apoptosis induced by HCPT.},

Imiquimod also exerts direct pro-apoptotic effects on tumor cells in vitro , but a role for these effects in imiquimod-induced tumor regression remains undefined. We previously demonstrated that cell lines derived from devil facial tumor disease (DFTD), a transmissible cancer threatening the survival of the Tasmanian devil ( Sarcophilus harrisii ), are sensitive to imiquimod-induced apoptosis. In this study, the pro-apoptotic effects of imiquimod in DFTD have been investigated using RNA-sequencing and label-free quantitative proteomics. This analysis revealed that changes to gene and protein expression in imiquimod treated DFTD cells are consistent with the onset of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses, and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response, autophagy, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Imiquimod also regulates the expression of oncogenic pathways, providing a direct mechanism by which this drug may increase tumor susceptibility to immune cytotoxicity in vivo . Our study has provided the first global analysis of imiquimod-induced effects in any tumor cell line. These findings have highlighted the potential of cell stress pathways as therapeutic targets in DFTD, and will allow for improved mechanistic use of imiquimod as a therapy in both the Tasmanian devil and human cancers.},

abstract = {The rise in the incidence of obesity has led to a major interest in the biology of white adipose tissue. The tissue is a major endocrine and signaling organ, with adipocytes, the characteristic cell type, secreting a multiplicity of protein factors, the adipokines. Increases in the secretion of a number of adipokines occur in obesity, underpinning inflammation in white adipose tissue and the development of obesity-associated diseases. There is substantial evidence, particularly from animal studies, that hypoxia develops in adipose tissue as the tissue mass expands, and the reduction in Po(2) is considered to underlie the inflammatory response. Exposure of white adipocytes to hypoxic conditions in culture induces changes in the expression of {\textgreater}1,000 genes. The secretion of a number of inflammation-related adipokines is upregulated by hypoxia, and there is a switch from oxidative metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis. Glucose utilization is increased in hypoxic adipocytes with corresponding increases in lactate production. Importantly, hypoxia induces insulin resistance in fat cells and leads to the development of adipose tissue fibrosis. Many of the responses of adipocytes to hypoxia are initiated at Po(2) levels above the normal physiological range for adipose tissue. The other cell types within the tissue also respond to hypoxia, with the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes being inhibited and preadipocytes being transformed into leptin-secreting cells. Overall, hypoxia has pervasive effects on the function of adipocytes and appears to be a key factor in adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity.},

However, the exact clinical significance and biological functions of miR-543 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. Here, we found that miR-543 expression significantly downregulated in tumors from patients with CRC, APC Min mice and a mouse model of colitis-associated colon cancer. miR-543 level was inversely correlated with the metastatic status of patients with CRC and the metastatic potential of CRC cell lines. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-543 inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting KRAS, MTA1 and HMGA2. Conversely, miR-543 knockdown promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC cells in vitro and augmented tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, we found that miR-543 expression was negatively correlated with the levels of KRAS, MTA1 and HMGA2 in clinical samples. Collectively, these data show that miR-543 inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells by targeting KRAS, MTA1 and HMGA2. Our study highlights a pivotal role for miR-543 as a suppressor in the regulation of CRC growth and metastasis and suggests that miR-543 may serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CRC metastasis.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor of adults and one of the most lethal of all cancers. Patients with this disease have a median survival of 15 months from the time of diagnosis despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. New treatment approaches are needed. Recent works suggest that glioblastoma patients may benefit from molecularly targeted therapies. Here, we address the compelling need for identification of new molecular targets. Leveraging global gene expression data from two independent sets of clinical tumor samples (n = 55 and n = 65), we identify a gene coexpression module in glioblastoma that is also present in breast cancer and significantly overlaps with the "metasignature" for undifferentiated cancer. Studies in an isogenic model system demonstrate that this module is downstream of the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFRvIII, and that it can be inhibited by the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Erlotinib. We identify ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) as a key gene within this module and demonstrate its overexpression in glioblastoma relative to normal brain (or body tissues). Finally, we show that ASPM inhibition by siRNA-mediated knockdown inhibits tumor cell proliferation and neural stem cell proliferation, supporting ASPM as a potential molecular target in glioblastoma. Our weighted gene coexpression network analysis provides a blueprint for leveraging genomic data to identify key control networks and molecular targets for glioblastoma, and the principle eluted from our work can be applied to other cancers.},

abstract = {We are beginning to elucidate transcriptional regulatory networks on a large scale and to understand some of the structural principles of these networks, but the evolutionary mechanisms that form these networks are still mostly unknown. Here we investigate the role of gene duplication in network evolution. Gene duplication is the driving force for creating new genes in genomes: at least 50{\%} of prokaryotic genes and over 90{\%} of eukaryotic genes are products of gene duplication. The transcriptional interactions in regulatory networks consist of multiple components, and duplication processes that generate new interactions would need to be more complex. We define possible duplication scenarios and show that they formed the regulatory networks of the prokaryote Escherichia coli and the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gene duplication has had a key role in network evolution: more than one-third of known regulatory interactions were inherited from the ancestral transcription factor or target gene after duplication, and roughly one-half of the interactions were gained during divergence after duplication. In addition, we conclude that evolution has been incremental, rather than making entire regulatory circuits or motifs by duplication with inheritance of interactions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Defining the metabolic limitations of tumour growth will help to develop cancer therapies1. Cancer cells proliferate slower in tumours than in standard culture conditions, indicating that a metabolic limitation may restrict cell proliferation in vivo. Aspartate synthesis can limit cancer cell proliferation when respiration is impaired2-4; however, whether acquiring aspartate is endogenously limiting for tumour growth is unknown. We confirm that aspartate has poor cell permeability, which prevents environmental acquisition, whereas the related amino acid asparagine is available to cells in tumours, but cancer cells lack asparaginase activity to convert asparagine to aspartate. Heterologous expression of guinea pig asparaginase 1 (gpASNase1), an enzyme that produces aspartate from asparagine5, confers the ability to use asparagine to supply intracellular aspartate to cancer cells in vivo. Tumours expressing gpASNase1 grow at a faster rate, indicating that aspartate acquisition is an endogenous metabolic limitation for the growth of some tumours. Tumours expressing gpASNase1 are also refractory to the growth suppressive effects of metformin, suggesting that metformin inhibits tumour growth by depleting aspartate. These findings suggest that therapeutic aspartate suppression could be effective to treat cancer.},

abstract = {The current anti-cancer therapeutic armamentarium consists of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, and combinations thereof. Initial treatments usually result in objective clinical responses with prolongation of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in a large subset of the treated patients. However, at the onset, there is a subset of patients who does not respond and another subset that initially responded but experiences relapses and recurrences. These latter subsets of patients develop a state of cross-resistance to a variety of unrelated therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to first unravel the underlying mechanisms of resistance and associated gene products that regulate the cross-resistance. Such gene products are potential therapeutic targets as well as potential prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers. In this context, we have identified three interrelated gene products involved in resistance, namely, Snail, YY1, and RKIP that are components of the dysregulated NF-$\kappa$B/Snail/YY1/RKIP loop in many cancers. In this review, we will discuss the roles each of Snail, YY1 and RKIP in the regulation of tumor cell resistance to chemo and immunotherapies. Since these same gene products have also been shown to be involved in the regulation of the EMT phenotype and metastasis, we suggest that targeting any of these three gene products can simultaneously inhibit tumor cell resistance and metastasis.},

This study was designed to report the identification of a novel lncRNA, lnc-GNAT1-1, and its functional role in CRC progression. METHODS lncRNA expression profile microarray was performed in three paired primary and liver metastatic tissues of CRC, and a novel lncRNA, lnc-GNAT1-1, was identified to be a potential functional lncRNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect its expression in CRC tissues, cell lines, and patients' plasma, cell fractionation was used to evaluate its subcellular location. lnc-GNAT1-1 was knockdown by siRNA or overexpressed by a lentivirus vector, then in vitro an vivo experiments were performed to evaluate its biological role and the underlying mechanisms in CRC. RESULTS Expression of lnc-GNAT1-1 was decreased in liver metastasis than the primary tumor, while the later one is lower than the paired normal mucosa. Decreased lnc-GNAT1-1 expression was associated unfavorable clinicopathological features and a poor prognosis of CRC patients. In multivariate analysis, lnc-GNAT1-1 was proved to be an independent prognostic factor. In plasma, lnc-GNAT1-1 was significant decreased in CRC patients than healthy donors, and with the TNM stages advanced, the plasma lnc-GNAT1-1 level decreased; Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) showed that plasma lnc-GNAT1-1 had a moderate to well diagnostic efficiency for CRC. In vitro experiments showed that knockdown of lnc-GNAT1-1 could inhibit the aggressive phenotypes of CRC cell lines. In vivo study showed that overexpression of lnc-GNAT1-1 could suppress the liver metastasis of CRC cells. Finally, we explored the underlying mechanism of the role lnc-GNAT1-1 plays in CRC, and found a positive correlation between lnc-GNAT1-1 and Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) expression both in cells and in patients' tissues. We further found that lnc-GNAT1-1 could regulate the RKIP-NF-$\kappa$B-Snail circuit in CRC. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated in this study that a novel lncRNA, lnc-GNAT1-1, is low expressed in colorectal cancer tissues and plasma, and acts as a tumor suppressor through regulating RKIP-NF-$\kappa$B-Snail circuit.},

Albeit the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis has been targeted, the biological mechanism underlying the lethal event of androgen independence remains unclear. New emerging evidences indicate that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) play crucial roles during the development of castration-resistance and metastasis of prostate cancer. Notably, EMT may be a dynamic process. Castration can induce EMT that may enhance the stemness of CSCs, which in turn results in castration-resistance and metastasis. Reverse of EMT may attenuate the stemness of CSCs and inhibit castration-resistance and metastasis. These prospective approaches suggest that therapies target EMT and CSCs may cast a new light on the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in the future. Here we review recent progress of EMT and CSCs in CRPC.},

abstract = {Summary To understand the relationship between an enhancer DNA sequence and quantitative gene expression, thermodynamics-driven mathematical models of transcription are often employed. These "sequence-to-expression" models can describe an incomplete or even incorrect set of regulatory relationships if the parameter space is not searched systematically. Here, we focus on an enhancer of the Drosophila gene ind and demonstrate how a systematic search of parameter space can reveal a more comprehensive picture of a gene's regulatory mechanisms, resolve outstanding ambiguities, and suggest testable hypotheses. We describe an approach that generates an ensemble of ind models; all of these models are technically acceptable solutions to the sequence-to-expression problem in light of wild-type data, and some represent mechanistically distinct hypotheses about the regulation of ind. This ensemble can be restricted to biologically plausible models using requirements gleaned from in vivo perturbation experiments. Biologically plausible models make unique predictions about how specific ind enhancer sequences affect ind expression; we validate these predictions in vivo through site mutagenesis in transgenic Drosophila embryos.},

abstract = {The innate immune system is currently seen as the probable initiator of events which culminate in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) known to be involved in this disease process. Many regulators of TLRs have been described, and dysregulation of these may also be important in the pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of this study was to perform a co-ordinated analysis of the expression levels of both key intestinal TLRs and their inhibitory proteins in the same IBD cohorts, both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), in order to evaluate the potential roles of these proteins in the pathogenesis of IBD. Of the six TLRs (TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 9) examined, only TLR-4 was increased significantly in IBD, specifically in active UC. In contrast, differential alterations in expression of TLR inhibitory proteins were observed. A20 and suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) were increased only in active UC while interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-m) and B cell lymphoma 3 protein (Bcl-3) were increased in both active UC and CD. In contrast, expression of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and Toll interacting protein (Tollip) was decreased in both active and inactive UC and CD and at both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, expression of both PPARgamma and A20 expression was increased by stimulation of a colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2 with both TLR ligands and commensal bacterial strains. These data suggest that IBD may be associated with distinctive changes in TLR-4 and TLR inhibitory proteins, implying that alterations in these may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD.},

abstract = {We report the generation and comparative analysis of genome-wide chromatin state maps, PPAR$\gamma$ and CTCF localization maps, and gene expression profiles from murine and human models of adipogenesis. The data provide high-resolution views of chromatin remodeling during cellular differentiation and allow identification of thousands of putative preadipocyte- and adipocyte-specific cis-regulatory elements based on dynamic chromatin signatures. We find that the specific locations of most such elements differ between the two models, including at orthologous loci with similar expression patterns. Based on sequence analysis and reporter assays, we show that these differences are determined, in part, by evolutionary turnover of transcription factor motifs in the genome sequences and that this turnover may be facilitated by the presence of multiple distal regulatory elements at adipogenesis-dependent loci. We also utilize the close relationship between open chromatin marks and transcription factor motifs to identify and validate PLZF and SRF as regulators of adipogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Among all tumor suppressor microRNAs, reduced let-7 expression occurs most frequently in cancer and typically correlates with poor prognosis. Activation of either LIN28A or LIN28B, two highly related RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and proto-oncogenes, is responsible for the global post-transcriptional downregulation of the let-7 microRNA family observed in many cancers. Specifically, LIN28A binds the terminal loop of precursor let-7 and recruits the Terminal Uridylyl Transferase (TUTase) ZCCHC11 that polyuridylates pre-let-7, thereby blocking microRNA biogenesis and tumor suppressor function. For LIN28B, the precise mechanism responsible for let-7 inhibition remains controversial. Functionally, the decrease in let-7 microRNAs leads to overexpression of their oncogenic targets such as MYC, RAS, HMGA2, BLIMP1, among others. Furthermore, mouse models demonstrate that ectopic LIN28 expression is sufficient to drive and/or accelerate tumorigenesis via a let-7 dependent mechanism. In this review, the LIN28/let-7 pathway is discussed, emphasizing its role in tumorigenesis, cancer stem cell biology, metabolomics, metastasis, and resistance to ionizing radiation and several chemotherapies. Also, emerging evidence will be presented suggesting that molecular targeting of this pathway may provide therapeutic benefit in cancer.},

abstract = {Cell proliferation includes a series of events that is tightly regulated by several checkpoints and layers of control mechanisms. Most studies have been performed on large cell populations, but detailed understanding of cell dynamics and heterogeneity requires single-cell analysis. Here, we used quantitative real-time PCR, profiling the expression of 93 genes in single-cells from three different cell lines. Individual unsynchronized cells from three different cell lines were collected in different cell cycle phases (G0/G1 - S - G2/M) with variable cell sizes. We found that the total transcript level per cell and the expression of most individual genes correlated with progression through the cell cycle, but not with cell size. By applying the random forests algorithm, a supervised machine learning approach, we show how a multi-gene signature that classifies individual cells into their correct cell cycle phase and cell size can be generated. To identify the most predictive genes we used a variable selection strategy. Detailed analysis of cell cycle predictive genes allowed us to define subpopulations with distinct gene expression profiles and to calculate a cell cycle index that illustrates the transition of cells between cell cycle phases. In conclusion, we provide useful experimental approaches and bioinformatics to identify informative and predictive genes at the single-cell level, which opens up new means to describe and understand cell proliferation and subpopulation dynamics.},

abstract = {The development of cutaneous melanoma is influenced by genetic factors, including BRAF mutations and environmental factors, such as ultraviolet exposure. Its progression has been also associated with the involvement of several tumour microenvironmental molecules. Among these, nuclear factorkappaB (NFkappaB) has been indicated as a key player of osteopontin (OPN) and matrix metalloproteinase9 (MMP9) activation. However, whether NFkappaB plays a role in the development and progression of melanoma in association with the OPN/MMP9 axis according to the BRAFV600E mutation status has not been investigated in detail to date. Thus, in the present study, in order to shed light on this matter, 148 patients with melanoma and 53 healthy donors were recruited for the analysis of OPN, MMP9 and NFkappaB. Significantly higher circulating levels of OPN and MMP9 were observed in the patients with melanoma when compared to the healthy donors. Similar data were obtained for NFkappaB p65 activity. The OPN levels did not differ significantly between melanomas with or without BRAFV600E mutation. However, as regards NFkappaB and MMP9, significant differences were observed between the melanomas with or without BRAFV600E mutation. To determine whether NFkappaB inhibition is associated with a decrease in the levels of OPN and MMP9, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 29 patients with melanoma were treated with the NFkappaB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomycin (DHMEQ), with or without OPN. As expected, the inhibition of NFkappaB induced a marked decrease in both the OPN and MMP9 levels. Furthermore, the decrease in MMP9 levels was higher among melanomas harbouring the BRAFV600E mutation. Overall, our data suggest that the activation of MMP9 is associated with the BRAFV600E mutation status. Furthermore, such an activation is mediated by NFkappaB, suggesting its role as therapeutic target in patients with melanoma.},

The LRRK2 protein contains several domains that suggest a role in cellular signaling, including a kinase domain. It is also clear that LRRK2 interacts, either physically or genetically, with several other important proteins implicated in PD, suggesting that LRRK2 may be a central player in the pathways that underlie parkinsonism. As such, LRRK2 has been proposed to be a plausible target for therapeutic intervention, with kinase inhibition being pursued most actively. However, there are still several fundamental aspects of LRRK2 biology and function that remain unresolved at this time. This review will focus on the key questions of normal function of LRRK2 and how this might be related to the pathophysiology of PD.},

In contrast, the Raf kinase inhibitor, RKIP, a negative modulator of RAF-stimulated MEKK activation, is strongly downregulated in metastatic melanoma cells. In this study, we explored a hypothesized inverse relationship between MDA-9 and RKIP in melanoma. Tumor array and cell line analyses confirmed an inverse relationship between expression of MDA-9 and RKIP during melanoma progression. We found that MDA-9 transcriptionally downregulated RKIP in support of a suggested cross-talk between these two proteins. Furthermore, MDA-9 and RKIP physically interacted in a manner that correlated with a suppression of FAK and c-Src phosphorylation, crucial steps necessary for MDA-9 to promote FAK/c-Src complex formation and initiate signaling cascades that drive the MDA-9-mediated metastatic phenotype. Finally, ectopic RKIP expression in melanoma cells overrode MDA-9-mediated signaling, inhibiting cell invasion, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo dissemination of tumor cells. Taken together, these findings establish RKIP as an inhibitor of MDA-9-dependent melanoma metastasis, with potential implications for targeting this process therapeutically.},

The dynamic association of these proteins with RNA defines the lifetime, cellular localization, processing and the rate at which a specific mRNA is translated. One of the pathways involved in regulating of mRNA stability is mediated by adenylate uridylate-rich element (ARE) binding proteins. These proteins are involved in processes of apoptosis, tumorigenesis and development. Out of many ARE-binding proteins, two of them AUF1 and HuR were studied most extensively and reported to regulate the mRNA stability in vivo. Our previously published data demonstrate that both proteins are involved in thyroid carcinogenesis. Several other reports postulate that mRNA binding proteins may participate in thyroid hormone actions. However, until now, exacts mechanisms and the possible role of post-transcriptional regulation and especially the role of AUF1 and HuR in those processes remain not fully understood. In this study we shortly review the possible function of both proteins in relation to development and various physiological and pathophysiological processes, including thyroid function and disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is evidence that genes and their protein products are organized into functional modules according to cellular processes and pathways. Gene co-expression networks have been used to describe the relationships between gene transcripts. Ample literature exists on how to detect biologically meaningful modules in networks but there is a need for methods that allow one to study the relationships between modules. RESULTS: We show that network methods can also be used to describe the relationships between co-expression modules and present the following methodology. First, we describe several methods for detecting modules that are shared by two or more networks (referred to as consensus modules). We represent the gene expression profiles of each module by an eigengene. Second, we propose a method for constructing an eigengene network, where the edges are undirected but maintain information on the sign of the co-expression information. Third, we propose methods for differential eigengene network analysis that allow one to assess the preservation of network properties across different data sets. We illustrate the value of eigengene networks in studying the relationships between consensus modules in human and chimpanzee brains; the relationships between consensus modules in brain, muscle, liver, and adipose mouse tissues; and the relationships between male-female mouse consensus modules and clinical traits. In some applications, we find that module eigengenes can be organized into higher level clusters which we refer to as meta-modules. CONCLUSION: Eigengene networks can be effective and biologically meaningful tools for studying the relationships between modules of a gene co-expression network. The proposed methods may reveal a higher order organization of the transcriptome.

This review considers how TFs are identified and functionally characterized, principally through the lens of a catalog of over 1,600 likely human TFs and binding motifs for two-thirds of them. Major classes of human TFs differ markedly in their evolutionary trajectories and expression patterns, underscoring distinct functions. TFs likewise underlie many different aspects of human physiology, disease, and variation, highlighting the importance of continued effort to understand TF-mediated gene regulation. Knowing how and where transcription factors bind to the genome is crucial for understanding how they control gene expression.

abstract = {Through the canonical LC3 interaction motif (LIR), [W/F/Y]‐X1‐X2‐[I/L/V], protein complexes are recruited to autophagosomes to perform their functions as either autophagy adaptors or receptors. How these adaptors/receptors selectively interact with either LC3 or GABARAP families remains unclear. Herein, we determine the range of selectivity of 30 known core LIR motifs towards individual LC3s and GABARAPs. From these, we define a GABARAP Interaction Motif (GIM) sequence ([W/F]‐[V/I]‐X2‐V) that the adaptor protein PLEKHM1 tightly conforms to. Using biophysical and structural approaches, we show that the PLEKHM1‐LIR is indeed 11‐fold more specific for GABARAP than LC3B. Selective mutation of the X1 and X2 positions either completely abolished the interaction with all LC3 and GABARAPs or increased PLEKHM1‐GIM selectivity 20‐fold towards LC3B. Finally, we show that conversion of p62/SQSTM1, FUNDC1 and FIP200 LIRs into our newly defined GIM, by introducing two valine residues, enhances their interaction with endogenous GABARAP over LC3B. The identification of a GABARAP‐specific interaction motif will aid the identification and characterization of the expanding array of autophagy receptor and adaptor proteins and their in vivo functions.},

Epithelial plasticity is known to be important for metastatic dissemination and therapeutic resistance. The goal of this study is to elucidate the functional consequence of induced epithelial plasticity on AR regulation during disease progression to identify factors important for treatment-resistant and metastatic prostate cancer. We pinpoint the epithelial plasticity transcription factor, Snail, at the nexus of enzalutamide resistance and prostate cancer metastasis both in preclinical models of prostate cancer and in patients. In patients, Snail expression is associated with Gleason 9-10 high-risk disease and is strongly overexpressed in metastases as compared to localized prostate cancer. Snail expression is also elevated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells compared to enzalutamide-sensitive cells, and downregulation of Snail re-sensitizes enzalutamide-resistant cells to enzalutamide. While activation of Snail increases migration and invasion, it is also capable of promoting enzalutamide resistance in enzalutamide-sensitive cells. This Snail-mediated enzalutamide resistance is a consequence of increased full-length AR and AR-V7 expression and nuclear localization. Downregulation of either full-length AR or AR-V7 re-sensitizes cells to enzalutamide in the presence of Snail, thus connecting Snail-induced enzalutamide resistance directly to AR biology. Finally, we demonstrate that Snail is capable of mediating-resistance through AR even in the absence of AR-V7. These findings imply that increased Snail expression during progression to metastatic disease may prime cells for resistance to AR-targeted therapies by promoting AR activity in prostate cancer.},

A number of proteins bound at the same genomic location can identify a multi-protein chromatin complex where several proteins work together to regulate gene transcription or chromatin configuration. In many instances, this can be achieved using sequential ChIP; or simply, ChIP-re-ChIP. Whether it is for the examination of specific transcriptional or epigenetic regulators, or for the identification of cistromes, the ability to perform a sequential ChIP adds a higher level of power and definition to these analyses. In this chapter, we describe a simple and reliable method for the sequential ChIP assay.},

Here, we show that the expression of RKIP negatively correlates with that of Snail zinc-transcriptional repressor, a key modulator of normal and neoplastic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. With a combination of loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we showed that Snail repressed the expression of RKIP in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. The effect of Snail on RKIP was on the level of transcriptional initiation and mediated by a proximal E-box on the RKIP promoter. Our results therefore suggest that RKIP is a novel component of the Snail transcriptional regulatory network important for the progression and metastasis of cancer.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The concept of a post-natal “mesenchymal stem cell” (“MSC”) originated from studies focused on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which are non-hematopoietic adherent cells, a subset of which are skeletal stem cells (SSCs), able to form cartilage, bone, hematopoiesis-supportive stroma, and marrow adipocytes based on rigorous clonal and differentiation assays. Subsequently, it was speculated that BMSCs could form other mesodermal derivatives and even cell types from other germ layers. Based on BMSC surface markers, representative of fibroblastic cells, and imprecise differentiation assays, it was further imagined that “MSCs” are ubiquitous and equipotent. However, “MSCs” do not have a common embryonic origin and are not a lineage, but recent studies indicate that they are tissue-specific stem/progenitor cells. These cells share cell surface features owing to their fibroblastic nature, but they are not identical. They display different differentiation capacities based on their tissue origin but do not “trans-differentiate” outside of their lineage, based on rigorous assays. For these reasons, the “MSC” term should be abandoned. Tissue-specific stem/progenitor cells provide the opportunity to devise methods for tissue regeneration by the cells themselves (tissue engineering). Their use in other forms of regenerative medicine based on paracrine, immunosuppressive, and immunomodulatory effects is far less clear.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Objective: We propose here material-induced senescence (MIS) as a new therapeutic concept that limits cancer progression by stable cell cycle arrest. This study examined for the first time the effect of material fluidity on cellular senescence in lung carcinoma using poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone-co-D, L-lactide) (P(CL-co-DLLA)) with tunable elasticity and fluidity. Methods: The fluidity was varied by chemically crosslinking the polymer networks: the crosslinked P(CL-co-DLLA) shows solid-like properties with a stiffness of 260 kPa, while the non-crosslinked polymer exists in a quasi-liquid state with loss and storage moduli of 33 kPa and 11 kPa, respectively. Results: We found that cancer cells growing on the non-crosslinked, fluidic substrate undergo a non-apoptotic form of cell death and the cell cycle was accumulated in a G0/G1 phase. Next, we investigated the expression of biomarkers that are associated with cancer pathways. The cancer cells on the fluidic substrate expressed several biomarkers associated with senescence such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5). This result indicates that when cancer cells sense fluidity in their surroundings, the cells express IGFBP5, which in turn triggers the expression of tumor suppressor protein 53 and initiates cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase followed by cellular senescence. Furthermore, the cancer cells on the fluidic substrate maintained their epithelial phenotype, suggesting that the cancer cells do not undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Conclusion: By considering these results as the fundamental information for MIS, our system could be applied to induce senescence in treatment-resistant cancers such as metastatic cancer or cancer stem cells.},

abstract = {Vacuolar protein-sorting 34 (Vps34), the catalytic subunit in the class III PtdIns3 (phosphatidylinositol 3) kinase complexes, mediates the production of PtdIns3P, a key intracellular lipid involved in regulating autophagy and receptor degradation. However, the signal transduction pathways by which extracellular signals regulate Vps34 complexes and the downstream cellular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that DNA damage-activated mitotic arrest and CDK activation lead to the phosphorylation of Vps34, which provides a signal to promote its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation mediated by FBXL20 (an F-box protein) and the associated Skp1 (S-phase kinase-associated protein-1)-Cullin1 complex, leading to inhibition of autophagy and receptor endocytosis. Furthermore, we show that the expression of FBXL20 is regulated by p53-dependent transcription. Our study provides a molecular pathway by which DNA damage regulates Vps34 complexes and its downstream mechanisms, including autophagy and receptor endocytosis, through SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Since the expression of FBXL20 is regulated by p53-dependent transcription, the control of Vps34 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by FBXL20 and the associated SCF complex expression provides a novel checkpoint for p53 to regulate autophagy and receptor degradation in DNA damage response.},

abstract = {Non-coding RNAs with a length of more than 200 nucleotides are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which have gained tremendous attention in recent decades. Many studies have confirmed that lncRNAs have important influence in post-transcriptional gene regulation; for example, lncRNAs affect the stability and translation of splicing factor proteins. The mutations and malfunctions of lncRNAs are closely related to human disorders. As lncRNAs interact with a variety of proteins, predicting the interaction between lncRNAs and proteins is a significant way to depth exploration functions and enrich annotations of lncRNAs. Experimental approaches for lncRNA⁻protein interactions are expensive and time-consuming. Computational approaches to predict lncRNA⁻protein interactions can be grouped into two broad categories. The first category is based on sequence, structural information and physicochemical property. The second category is based on network method through fusing heterogeneous data to construct lncRNA related heterogeneous network. The network-based methods can capture the implicit feature information in the topological structure of related biological heterogeneous networks containing lncRNAs, which is often ignored by sequence-based methods. In this paper, we summarize and discuss the materials, interaction score calculation algorithms, advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art algorithms of lncRNA⁻protein interaction prediction based on network methods to assist researchers in selecting a suitable method for acquiring more dependable results. All the related different network data are also collected and processed in convenience of users, and are available at https://github.com/HAN-Siyu/APINet/.},

Based on large-scale yeast microarray expression data, we use the shortest-path analysis to identify transitive genes between two given genes from the same biological process. We find that not only functionally related genes with correlated expression profiles are identified but also those without. In the latter case, we compare our method to hierarchical clustering, and show that our method can reveal functional relationships among genes in a more precise manner. Finally, we show that our method can be used to reliably predict the function of unknown genes from known genes lying on the same shortest path. We assigned functions for 146 yeast genes that are considered as unknown by the Saccharomyces Genome Database and by the Yeast Proteome Database.

CS group B protein (CSB), which is the gene product of one of the genes responsible for CS, belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 DNA-dependent ATPase family and has an ATPase domain and an ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) in the central region and the C-terminal region, respectively. The C-terminal region containing the UBD is essential for the functions of CSB. In this study, we generated several CSB deletion mutants and analyzed the functions of the C-terminal region of CSB in TC-NER. Not only the UBD but also the C-terminal 30-amino acid residues were required for UV light resistance and TC-NER. This region was needed for the interaction of CSB with RNA polymerase II, the translocation of CS group A protein to the nuclear matrix, and the association of CSB with chromatin after UV irradiation. CSB was modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier 2/3 in a UV light-dependent manner. This modification was abolished in a CSB mutant lacking the C-terminal 30 amino acid residues. However, the substitution of lysine residues in this region with arginine did not affect SUMOylation or TC-NER. By contrast, substitution of a lysine residue in the N-terminal region with arginine decreased SUMOylation and resulted in cells with defects in TC-NER. These results indicate that both the most C-terminal region and SUMOylation are important for the functions of CSB in TC-NER.},

Endogenous FoxO1 was required for autophagy in human cancer cell lines in response to oxidative stress or serum starvation, but this process was independent of the transcriptional activity of FoxO1. In response to stress, FoxO1 was acetylated by dissociation from sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), a NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase, and the acetylated FoxO1 bound to Atg7, an E1-like protein, to influence the autophagic process leading to cell death. This FoxO1-modulated cell death is associated with tumour suppressor activity in human colon tumours and a xenograft mouse model. Our finding links the anti-neoplastic activity of FoxO1 and the process of autophagy.},

Nitric oxide involvement in the response to this endocrine treatment and its influence upon estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progression is still unclear.   Nitric oxide impact on the MCF7 breast cancer line, before and after estrogen-induced apoptosis, was investigated in 3D culture systems using unique live-cell imaging methodologies.   Spheroids were established from MCF7 cells vulnerable to estrogen-induced apoptosis, before and after exposure to estrogen.   Spheroids derived from estrogen-treated cells exhibited extensive apoptosis levels with downregulation of estrogen receptor expression, low proliferation rate and reduced metabolic activity, unlike spheroids derived from non-treated cells. In addition to basic phenotypic differences, these two cell cluster types are diverse in their reactions to exogenous nitric oxide.   A dual effect of nitric oxide was observed in the breast cancer phenotype sensitive to estrogen-induced apoptosis. Nitric oxide, at the nanomolar level, induced cell proliferation, high metabolic activity, downregulation of estrogen receptor and enhanced collective invasion, contributing to a more aggressive phenotype. Following hormone supplementation, breast cancer 3D clusters were rescued from estrogen-induced apoptosis by these low nitric oxide-donor concentrations, since nitric oxide attenuates cell death levels, upregulates survivin expression and increases metabolic activity.   Higher nitric oxide concentrations (100nM) inhibited cell growth, metabolism and promoted apoptosis. These results suggest that nitric oxide, in nanomolar concentrations, may inhibit estrogen-induced apoptosis, playing a major role in hormonal therapy. Inhibiting nitric oxide activity may benefit breast cancer patients and ultimately reduce tumor recurrence.},

abstract = {Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is essential for transcriptional silencing of Polycomb target genes, whereas acetylation of H3K27 (H3K27ac) has recently been shown to be associated with many active mammalian genes. The Trithorax protein (TRX), which associates with the histone acetyltransferase CBP, is required for maintenance of transcriptionally active states and antagonizes Polycomb silencing, although the mechanism underlying this antagonism is unknown. Here we show that H3K27 is specifically acetylated by Drosophila CBP and its deacetylation involves RPD3. H3K27ac is present at high levels in early embryos and declines after 4 hours as H3K27me3 increases. Knockdown of E(Z) decreases H3K27me3 and increases H3K27ac in bulk histones and at the promoter of the repressed Polycomb target gene abd-A, suggesting that these indeed constitute alternative modifications at some H3K27 sites. Moderate overexpression of CBP in vivo causes a global increase in H3K27ac and a decrease in H3K27me3, and strongly enhances Polycomb mutant phenotypes. We also show that TRX is required for H3K27 acetylation. TRX overexpression also causes an increase in H3K27ac and a concomitant decrease in H3K27me3 and leads to defects in Polycomb silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA microarray (ChIP-chip) analysis reveals that H3K27ac and H3K27me3 are mutually exclusive and that H3K27ac and H3K4me3 signals coincide at most sites. We propose that TRX-dependent acetylation of H3K27 by CBP prevents H3K27me3 at Polycomb target genes and constitutes a key part of the molecular mechanism by which TRX antagonizes or prevents Polycomb silencing.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Chronic inflammation promotes development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). We explored the distribution of the corticotropin-releasing-hormone (CRH) family of receptors and ligands in CRC and their contribution in tumor growth and oncogenic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Methods: The mRNA expression of CRH-family members was analyzed in CRC (n = 56) and control (n = 46) samples, seven CRC cell lines, and normal NCM460 cells. Immunohistochemical detection of CRHR2 was performed in 20 CRC and five normal tissues. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were compared between urocortin-2 (Ucn2)-stimulated parental and CRHR2-overexpressing (CRHR2+) cells in the absence or presence of interleukin-6 (IL-6). CRHR2/Ucn2-targeted effects on tumor growth and EMT were validated in SW620-xenograft mouse models. Results: CRC tissues and cell lines showed decreased mRNA and protein CRHR2 expression compared with controls and NCM460 cells, respectively. The opposite trend was shown for Ucn2. CRHR2/Ucn2 signaling inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation in CRC-CRHR2+cells. In vivo, SW620-CRHR2+xenografts showed decreased growth, reduced expression of EMT-inducers, and elevated levels of EMT-suppressors. IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-6R mRNAs were diminished in CRC-CRHR2+cells, while CRHR2/Ucn2 signaling inhibited IL-6-mediated Stat3 activation, invasion, migration, and expression of downstream targets acting as cell cycle- and EMT-inducers. Expression of cell cycle- and EMT-suppressors was augmented in IL-6/Ucn2-stimulated CRHR2+cells. In patients, CRHR2 mRNA expression was inversely correlated with IL-6R and vimentin levels and metastasis occurrence, while positively associated with E-cadherin expression and overall survival. Conclusions: CRHR2 down-regulation in CRC supports tumor expansion and spread through maintaining persistent inflammation and constitutive Stat3 activation. CRHR2lowCRC phenotypes are associated with higher risk for distant metastases and poor clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that weight reduction with orlistat plus mild caloric restriction leads to better blood pressure control than diet alone in obese individuals with inadequately controlled hypertension. DESIGN This was a 1-year, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of orlistat plus diet versus placebo plus diet in obese hypertensives. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive either orlistat or placebo; all received a 600 kcal deficient diet with no more than 30{\%} of calories from fat. Weight and blood pressure, lipid levels and fasting glucose and insulin levels were followed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients on orlistat experienced greater weight loss (-5.4 +/- 6.4 versus -2.7 +/- 6.4 kg, P{\textless} 0.001) and greater reduction in body mass index (-1.9 +/- 2.3 versus -0.9 +/- 2.2 kg/m2, P{\textless}0.001). Target weight loss, defined as {\textgreater} or= 5{\%} body weight (BW), was obtained in more orlistat-treated patients than in the placebo group (46 versus 23{\%}, P{\textless}0.001). Diastolic BP decreased more in orlistat-treated patients than in the placebo group (-11.4 +/- 8.3 versus -9.2 +/- 8.4 mmHg, P = 0.002). A greater percentage of orlistat-treated patients reached goal diastolic blood pressure (BP), defined as final diastolic BP{\textless} 90 mmHg or a reduction of at least 10 mmHg (67 versus 53{\%}, P{\textless} 0.001). The orlistat-treated group had significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol ( P{\textless}0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.001) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P{\textless} 0.005) and target 30{\%} cardiovascular risk reduction was obtained in more orlistat-treated patients (36.1 versus 24.0{\%}, P{\textless} 0.04). CONCLUSION: A weight-loss program with orlistat is more effective than diet alone to lower blood pressure and results in greater cardiovascular risk reduction.},

Adipose tissue development and functional maintenance are dependent on adipocyte differentiation, in which autophagy plays an important role. It has been shown that autophagy deficiency dampens adipocyte differentiation, compromises adipose tissue development, dysregulates adipocytokine secretion, and even causes sudden death in young animals. Therefore, accurate assessment of autophagy in adipocyte is critical for the study of adipose biology or pathology of metabolic diseases. In this chapter, we described the procedure of autophagy analysis during adipocyte differentiation, and discussed the power of steady-state autophagy protein (e.g., beclin 1, LC3, and p62) levels versus autophagy flux to reflect autophagy activity.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its earlier stage, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). One source of oxidative stress in AD and aMCI brains is that associated with amyloid-$\beta$ peptide, A$\beta$1-42 oligomers. Our laboratory first showed in AD elevated oxidative stress occurred in brain regions rich in A$\beta$1-42, but not in A$\beta$1-42-poor regions, and was among the first to demonstrate A$\beta$ peptides led to lipid peroxidation (indexed by HNE) in AD and aMCI brains. Oxidatively modified proteins have decreased function and contribute to damaged key biochemical and metabolic pathways in which these proteins normally play a role. Identification of oxidatively modified brain proteins by the methods of redox proteomics was pioneered in the Butterfield laboratory. Four recurring altered pathways secondary to oxidative damage in brain from persons with AD, aMCI, or Down syndrome with AD are interrelated and contribute to neuronal death. This "Quadrilateral of Neuronal Death" includes altered: glucose metabolism, mTOR activation, proteostasis network, and protein phosphorylation. Some of these pathways are altered even in brains of persons with preclinical AD. We opine that targeting these pathways pharmacologically and with lifestyle changes potentially may provide strategies to slow or perhaps one day, prevent, progression or development of this devastating dementing disorder. This invited review outlines both in vitro and in vivo studies from the Butterfield laboratory related to A$\beta$1-42 and AD and discusses the importance and implications of some of the major achievements of the Butterfield laboratory in AD research.},

abstract = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of signaling receptors, are critically regulated by endosomal traffick-ing, suggesting that endosomes might provide new strategies for manipulating GPCR signaling. Here we test this hypothesis by focusing on class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Vps34), which is an essential regulator of endosomal trafficking. We verify that Vps34 is required for recycling of the b2-adrenoceptor (b2AR), a prototypical GPCR, and then investigate the effects of Vps34 inhibition on the canonical cAMP response elicited by b2AR activation. Vps34 inhibition impairs the ability of cells to recover this response after prolonged activation, which is in accord with the established role of recycling in GPCR resensitization. In addition, Vps34 inhibition also attenuates the short-term cAMP response, and its effect begins several minutes after initial agonist application. These results establish Vps34 as an essential de-terminant of both short-term and long-term canonical GPCR signaling, and support the potential utility of the endosomal system as a druggable target for signaling.},

abstract = {Although all human tissues carry out common processes, tissues are distinguished by gene expression patterns, implying that distinct regulatory programs control tissue specificity. In this study, we investigate gene expression and regulation across 38 tissues profiled in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We find that network edges (transcription factor to target gene connections) have higher tissue specificity than network nodes (genes) and that regulating nodes (transcription factors) are less likely to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner as compared to their targets (genes). Gene set enrichment analysis of network targeting also indicates that the regulation of tissue-specific function is largely independent of transcription factor expression. In addition, tissue-specific genes are not highly targeted in their corresponding tissue network. However, they do assume bottleneck positions due to variability in transcription factor targeting and the influence of non-canonical regulatory interactions. These results suggest that tissue specificity is driven by context-dependent regulatory paths, providing transcriptional control of tissue-specific processes. Understanding gene regulation is important for many fields in biology and medicine. Sonawane et al. reconstruct and investigate regulatory networks for 38 human tissues. They find that regulation of tissue-specific function is largely independent of transcription factor expression and that tissue specificity appears to be mediated by tissue-specific regulatory network paths.},

The latter regulates energy expenditure as well as mitochondrial biogenesis. The miR-378:miR-378* hairpin is highly expressed in cardiac cells. To better assess their role in cardiomyocytes, we identified miR-378 and miR-378* targets via a proteomic screen. We established H9c2 cellular models of overexpression of miR-378 and miR-378* and identified a total of 86 down-regulated proteins in the presence of either one of these miRs. Functional annotation clustering showed that miR-378 and miR-378* regulate related pathways in cardiomyocytes, including energy metabolism, notably glycolysis, cytoskeleton, notably actin filaments and muscle contraction. Using bioinformatics algorithms we found that 20 proteins were predicted as direct targets of the miRs. We validated eight of these targets by quantitative RT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. We found that miR-378 targets lactate dehydrogenase A and impacts on cell proliferation and survival whereas miR-378* targets cytoskeleton proteins actin and vimentin. Proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress response such as chaperone and/or calcium buffering proteins GRP78, PPIA (cyclophilin A), calumenin, and GMMPA involved in glycosylation are repressed by these miRs. Our results show that the miR-378/378* hairpin establishes a connection among energy metabolism, cytoskeleton remodeling, and endoplasmic reticulum function through post-transcriptional regulation of key proteins involved in theses pathways.},

COX-2 in TAMs induces MMP-9 expression and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells. In addition, COX-2/PGE2 induces IL-6 release in macrophages. Furthermore, we find that the activation of Akt pathway in cancer cells is crucial for the pro-metastatic effect of COX-2(+) TAMs by regulating MMP-9 and EMT. These findings indicate that TAMs facilitate breast cancer cell metastasis through COX-2-mediated intercellular communication.},

abstract = {Diazeniumdiolate-based aspirin prodrugs have previously been shown to retain the anti-inflammatory properties of aspirin while protecting against the common side effect of stomach ulceration. Initial analysis of two new prodrugs of aspirin that also release either nitroxyl (HNO) or nitric oxide (NO) demonstrated increased cytotoxicity toward human lung carcinoma cells compared to either aspirin or the parent nitrogen oxide donor. In addition, cytotoxicity was significantly lower in endothelial cells, suggesting cancer-specific sensitivity. To assess the chemotherapeutic potential of these new prodrugs in treatment of breast cancer, we studied their effect both in cultured cells and in a nude mouse model. Both prodrugs reduced growth of breast adenocarcinoma cells more effectively than the parent compounds while not being appreciably cytotoxic in a related nontumorigenic cell line (MCF-10A). The HNO donor also was more cytotoxic than the related NO donor. The basis for the observed specificity was investigated in terms of impact on metabolism, DNA damage and repair, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis. The results suggest a significant pharmacological potential for treatment of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a fundamental cellular process that is well conserved among eukaryotes. It is one of the strategies that cells use to catabolize substances in a controlled way. Autophagy is used for recycling cellular components, responding to cellular stresses and ridding cells of foreign material. Perturbations in autophagy have been implicated in a number of pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration, cardiac disease and cancer. The growing knowledge about autophagic mechanisms needs to be collected in a computable and shareable format to allow its use in data representation and interpretation. The Gene Ontology (GO) is a freely available resource that describes how and where gene products function in biological systems. It consists of 3 interrelated structured vocabularies that outline what gene products do at the biochemical level, where they act in a cell and the overall biological objectives to which their actions contribute. It also consists of 'annotations' that associate gene products with the terms. Here we describe how we represent autophagy in GO, how we create and define terms relevant to autophagy researchers and how we interrelate those terms to generate a coherent view of the process, therefore allowing an interoperable description of its biological aspects. We also describe how annotation of gene products with GO terms improves data analysis and interpretation, hence bringing a significant benefit to this field of study.},

In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of miR-23a in NPC radioresistance, one of downregulated miRNAs in the radioresistant NPC cells identified by our previous microarray analysis. We observed that miR-23a was frequently downregulated in the radioresistant NPC tissues, and its decrement correlated with NPC radioresistance and poor patient survival, and was an independent predictor for reduced patient survival. In vitro radioresponse assays showed that restoration of miR-23a expression markedly increased NPC cell radiosensitivity. In a mouse model, therapeutic administration of miR-23a agomir dramatically sensitized NPC xenografts to irradiation. Mechanistically, we found that reduced miR-23a promoted NPC cell radioresistance by activating IL-8/Stat3 signaling. Moreover, the levels of IL-8 and phospho-Stat3 were increased in the radioresistance NPC tissues, and negatively associated with miR-23a level. Our data demonstrate that miR-23a is a critical determinant of NPC radioresponse and prognostic predictor for NPC patients, and its decrement enhances NPC radioresistance through activating IL-8/Stat3 signaling, highlighting the therapeutic potential of miR-23a/IL-8/Stat3 signaling axis in NPC radiosensitization.},

Previous studies have reported that lncRNA XIST regulates tumor malignancies in several cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of XIST in prostate cancer remains unclear. In the current study, we found that XIST was down-regulated in prostate cancer specimens and cell lines. Low expression of XIST was correlated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stage in prostate cancer patients. In gain and loss of function assays, we confirmed that XIST suppressed cellular proliferation and metastasis in prostate cancer both  in vitro  and  in vivo . Furthermore, we found that XIST negatively regulates the expression of miR-23a and subsequently promotes RKIP expression at post-transcriptional level. Consequently, we investigated the correlation between XIST and miR-23a, and identified miR-23a as a direct target of XIST. In addition, over-expression of miR-23a efficiently abrogated the up-regulation of RKIP induced by XIST, suggesting that XIST positively regulates the expression of RKIP by competitively binding to miR-23a. Taken together, our study indicated that lncRNA XIST acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, and this regulatory effect of XIST will shed new light on epigenetic diagnostics and therapeutics in prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Even simple organisms have the ability to respond to internal and external stimuli. This response is carried out by a dynamic network of protein-DNA interactions that allows the specific regulation of genes needed for the response. We have developed a novel computational method that uses an input-output hidden Markov model to model these regulatory networks while taking into account their dynamic nature. Our method works by identifying bifurcation points, places in the time series where the expression of a subset of genes diverges from the rest of the genes. These points are annotated with the transcription factors regulating these transitions resulting in a unified temporal map. Applying our method to study yeast response to stress, we derive dynamic models that are able to recover many of the known aspects of these responses. Predictions made by our method have been experimentally validated leading to new roles for Ino4 and Gcn4 in controlling yeast response to stress. The temporal cascade of factors reveals common pathways and highlights differences between master and secondary factors in the utilization of network motifs and in condition-specific regulation. {\textcopyright} 2007 EMBO and Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein or RKIP was initially identified as a Raf-1 binding protein using the yeast 2-hybrid screen. RKIP inhibits the activation phosphorylation of MEK by Raf-1 by competitively inhibiting the binding of MEK to Raf-1 and thus exerting an inhibitory effect on the Raf-MEK-Erk pathway. RKIP has been identified as a metastasis suppressor gene. Expression of RKIP is low in cancer metastases. Although primary tumor growth remains unaffected, re- expression of RKIP inhibits cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, RKIP constrains metastasis by inhibiting angiogenesis, local invasion, intravasation, and colonization. The molecular mechanism of how RKIP inhibits these individual steps remains undefined. In our present study, using an unbiased PCR based screening and by analyzing DNA microarray expression datasets we observe that the expression of multiple metalloproteases (MMPs) including MMP1, MMP3, MMP10 and MMP13 are negatively correlated with RKIP expression in breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples. Since expression of MMPs by cancer cells is important for cancer metastasis, we hypothesize that RKIP may mediate suppression of breast cancer metastasis by inhibiting multiple MMPs. We show that the expression signature of RKIP and MMPs is better at predicting high metastatic risk than the individual gene. Using a combination of loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we find that MMP13 is the cause of RKIP-mediated inhibition of local cancer invasion. Interestingly expression of MMP13 alone is not sufficient to reverse the inhibition of breast cancer cell metastasis to the lung due to the expression of RKIP. We find that RKIP negatively regulates MMP13 through the Erk2 signaling pathway and the repression of MMP13 by RKIP is transcription factor AP-1 independent. Together, our findings indicate that RKIP inhibits cancer cell invasion, in part, via MMP13 inhibition. These data also implicate RKIP in the regulation of MMP transcription, suggesting a potential mechanism by which RKIP inhibits tumor progression and metastasis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Rab proteins provide specificity through their interaction with coat proteins, vesicle tethers and SNAREs.Recent data emerging from these studies have defined a subset of Rab proteins and their regulators, the RabGAPS (GTPase activating proteins) in both autophagosome formation and maturation.

abstract = {Dysregulation in signal transduction pathways can lead to a variety of complex disorders, including cancer. Computational approaches such as network analysis are important tools to understand system dynamics as well as to identify critical components that could be further explored as therapeutic targets. Here, we performed perturbation analysis of a large-scale signal transduction model in extracellular environments that stimulate cell death, growth, motility, and quiescence. Each of the model's components was perturbed under both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations. Using 1,300 simulations under both types of perturbations across various extracellular conditions, we identified the most and least influential components based on the magnitude of their influence on the rest of the system. Based on the premise that the most influential components might serve as better drug targets, we characterized them for biological functions, housekeeping genes, essential genes, and druggable proteins. The most influential components under all environmental conditions were enriched with several biological processes. The inositol pathway was found as most influential under inactivating perturbations, whereas the kinase and small lung cancer pathways were identified as the most influential under activating perturbations. The most influential components were enriched with essential genes and druggable proteins. Moreover, known cancer drug targets were also classified in influential components based on the affected components in the network. Additionally, the systemic perturbation analysis of the model revealed a network motif of most influential components which affect each other. Furthermore, our analysis predicted novel combinations of cancer drug targets with various effects on other most influential components. We found that the combinatorial perturbation consisting of PI3K inactivation and overactivation of IP3R1 can lead to increased activity levels of apoptosis-related components and tumor-suppressor genes, suggesting that this combinatorial perturbation may lead to a better target for decreasing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Finally, our approach shows a potential to identify and prioritize therapeutic targets through systemic perturbation analysis of large-scale computational models of signal transduction. Although some components of the presented computational results have been validated against independent gene expression data sets, more laboratory experiments are warranted to more comprehensively validate the presented results.},

abstract = {Blocking specific protein interactions can lead to human diseases. Accordingly, protein interactions and the structural knowledge on interacting surfaces of proteins (interfaces) have an important role in predicting the genotype-phenotype relationship. We have built the phenotype specific sub-networks of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving the relevant genes responsible for lung and brain metastasis from primary tumor in breast cancer. First, we selected the PPIs most relevant to metastasis causing genes (seed genes), by using the "guilt-by-association" principle. Then, we modeled structures of the interactions whose complex forms are not available in Protein Databank (PDB). Finally, we mapped mutations to interface structures (real and modeled), in order to spot the interactions that might be manipulated by these mutations. Functional analyses performed on these sub-networks revealed the potential relationship between immune system-infectious diseases and lung metastasis progression, but this connection was not observed significantly in the brain metastasis. Besides, structural analyses showed that some PPI interfaces in both metastasis sub-networks are originating from microbial proteins, which in turn were mostly related with cell adhesion. Cell adhesion is a key mechanism in metastasis, therefore these PPIs may be involved in similar molecular pathways that are shared by infectious disease and metastasis. Finally, by mapping the mutations and amino acid variations on the interface regions of the proteins in the metastasis sub-networks we found evidence for some mutations to be involved in the mechanisms differentiating the type of the metastasis.},

Immunofluorescent imaging indicates that WIPI49 is localized to both trans-Golgi and endosomal membranes, organelles between which it traffics in a microtubule-dependent manner. Live cell imaging establishes that WIPI49 traffics through the same set of endosomal membranes as that followed by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR), and consistent with this, WIPI49 is enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles. Ectopic expression of wild-type WIPI49 disrupts the proper functioning of this MPR pathway, whereas expression of a double point mutant (R221,222AWIPI49) unable to bind phosphoinositides does not disrupt this pathway. Finally, suppression of WIPI49 expression through RNAi, demonstrates that its presence is required for normal endosomal organization and distribution of the CI-MPR. We conclude that WIPI49 is a novel regulatory component of the endosomal and MPR pathway and that this role is dependent upon the PI-binding properties of its WD40 domain.},

abstract = {CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of inherited neurologic disorders in which iron accumulates in the basal ganglia resulting in progressive dystonia, spasticity, parkinsonism, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and optic atrophy or retinal degeneration. Ten types and their associated genes are recognized. The age of onset ranges from infancy to late adulthood; the rate of progression varies. Cognitive decline occurs in some subtypes, but more often cognition is relatively spared. Cerebellar atrophy is a frequent finding in some subtypes. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING The diagnosis is usually first suspected when brain MRI findings suggest abnormal brain iron accumulation. Clinical findings and molecular genetic testing establish the diagnosis of specific types. The ten genes known to be associated with types of NBIA are PANK2, PLA2G6, C19orf12, FA2H, ATP13A2, WDR45, COASY, FTL, CP, and DCAF17. GENETIC COUNSELING Eight of the ten genetically defined types of NBIA are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Exceptions are: beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), caused by de novo mutations in WDR45, which is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner with suspected male lethality; and neuroferritinopathy, caused by mutations in FTL, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. If the family-specific mutations are known, carrier testing for family members at risk for the autosomal recessive types and the X-linked type is possible, and prenatal testing for most types is possible. MANAGEMENT Treatment of manifestations: Intrathecal or oral baclofen, oral trihexyphenidyl, intramuscular botulinum toxin, and deep brain stimulation to treat dystonia; services for the blind, educational programs, assistive communication devices; adaptive aids (walkers, wheelchairs) for gait abnormalities. Prevention of secondary complications: Adequate nutrition through swallowing evaluation, dietary assessment, gastrostomy tube feeding as needed. Surveillance: Evaluation for treatable causes of pain during episodes of extreme dystonia; monitoring of height and weight; routine ophthalmologic assessment; regular assessments of ambulation and speech abilities.},

abstract = {Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in numerous types of cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous evidence that HGF has a role in prostate cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of HGF on EMT and invasive potential, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, in a human prostate cancer cell line. Therefore, PC-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of HGF for varying durations. EMT-associated proteins, including E-cadherin and vimentin, were examined by western blot analysis. The effects of HGF on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenicity were assessed using MTT, wound-healing, Transwell and soft-agar assays. Subsequently, the role of c-Met in the mediation of EMT-like changes was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis and gene knockdown by small interfering RNA. Finally, western blot analysis was used to quantify the expression of a downstream transcription factor and extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway proteins. The results indicated that treatment with HGF induced EMT-like changes and enhanced the invasive potential of PC-3 cells. There was an increase in the expression of ERK, phosphorylated-ERK and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox-1 (Zeb-1), suggesting that EMT-like changes may be mediated through the ERK/MAPK and Zeb-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, HGF-mediated EMT-like changes were associated with c-Met activation, and these changes were able to be blocked by c-Met knockdown. The present study demonstrated that HGF-induced EMT increased the invasive potential of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells through activating the ERK/MAPK and Zeb-1 signaling pathway.},

abstract = {Only a minority of those exposed to human papillomavirus (HPV) develop HPV-related cervical and oropharyngeal cancer. Because host immunity affects infection and progression to cancer, we tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in immune-related genes is a determinant of susceptibility to oropharyngeal cancer and other HPV-associated cancers by performing a multitier integrative computational analysis with oropharyngeal cancer data from a head and neck cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS). Independent analyses, including single-gene, gene-interconnectivity, protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and pathway analysis, identified immune genes and pathways significantly associated with oropharyngeal cancer. TGF$\beta$R1, which intersected all tiers of analysis and thus selected for validation, replicated significantly in the head and neck cancer GWAS limited to HPV-seropositive cases and an independent cervical cancer GWAS. The TGF$\beta$R1 containing p38-MAPK pathway was significantly associated with oropharyngeal cancer and cervical cancer, and TGF$\beta$R1 was overexpressed in oropharyngeal cancer, cervical cancer, and HPV(+) head and neck cancer tumors. These concordant analyses implicate TGF$\beta$R1 signaling as a process dysregulated across HPV-related cancers. This study demonstrates that genetic variation in immune-related genes is associated with susceptibility to oropharyngeal cancer and implicates TGF$\beta$R1/TGF$\beta$ signaling in the development of both oropharyngeal cancer and cervical cancer. Better understanding of the immunogenetic basis of susceptibility to HPV-associated cancers may provide insight into host/virus interactions and immune processes dysregulated in the minority of HPV-exposed individuals who progress to cancer.

abstract = {Quantitative models of cis-regulatory activity have the potential to improve our mechanistic understanding of transcriptional regulation. However, the few models available today have been based on simplistic assumptions about the sequences being modeled, or heuristic approximations of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We have developed a thermodynamics-based model to predict gene expression driven by any DNA sequence, as a function of transcription factor concentrations and their DNA-binding specificities. It uses statistical thermodynamics theory to model not only protein-DNA interaction, but also the effect of DNA-bound activators and repressors on gene expression. In addition, the model incorporates mechanistic features such as synergistic effect of multiple activators, short range repression, and cooperativity in transcription factor-DNA binding, allowing us to systematically evaluate the significance of these features in the context of available expression data. Using this model on segmentation-related enhancers in Drosophila, we find that transcriptional synergy due to simultaneous action of multiple activators helps explain the data beyond what can be explained by cooperative DNA-binding alone. We find clear support for the phenomenon of short-range repression, where repressors do not directly interact with the basal transcriptional machinery. We also find that the binding sites contributing to an enhancer's function may not be conserved during evolution, and a noticeable fraction of these undergo lineage-specific changes. Our implementation of the model, called GEMSTAT, is the first publicly available program for simultaneously modeling the regulatory activities of a given set of sequences. {\textcopyright} 2010 He et al.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As sex determines mammalian development, understanding the nature and developmental dynamics of the sexually dimorphic transcriptome is important. To explore this, we generated 76 genome-wide RNA-seq profiles from mouse eight-cell embryos, late gestation and adult livers, together with 4 ground-state pluripotent embryonic (ES) cell lines from which we generated both RNA-seq and multiple ChIP-seq profiles. We complemented this with previously published data to yield 5 snap-shots of pre-implantation development, late-gestation placenta and somatic tissue and multiple adult tissues for integrative analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We define a high-confidence sex-dimorphic signature of 69 genes in eight-cell embryos. Sex-chromosome-linked components of this signature are largely conserved throughout pre-implantation development and in ES cells, whilst the autosomal component is more dynamic. Sex-biased gene expression is reflected by enrichment for activating and repressive histone modifications. The eight-cell signature is largely non-overlapping with that defined from fetal liver, neither was it correlated with adult liver or other tissues analysed. The number of sex-dimorphic genes increases throughout development. We identified many more dimorphic genes in adult compared to fetal liver. However, approximately two thirds of the dimorphic genes identified in fetal liver were also dimorphic in adult liver. Sex-biased expression differences unique to adult liver were enriched for growth hormone-responsiveness. Sexually dimorphic gene expression in pre-implantation development is driven by sex-chromosome based transcription, whilst later development is characterised by sex dimorphic autosomal transcription.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This systematic study identifies three distinct phases of sex dimorphism throughout mouse development, and has significant implications for understanding the developmental origins of sex-specific phenotypes and disease in mammals.},

abstract = {The KDM5 family of histone demethylases removes the H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) mark frequently found at promoter regions of actively transcribed genes and is therefore generally considered to contribute to corepression. In this study, we show that knockdown (KD) of all expressed members of the KDM5 family in white and brown preadipocytes leads to deregulated gene expression and blocks differentiation to mature adipocytes. KDM5 KD leads to a considerable increase in H3K4me3 at promoter regions; however, these changes in H3K4me3 have a limited effect on gene expression per se. By contrast, genome-wide analyses demonstrate that KDM5A is strongly enriched at KDM5-activated promoters, which generally have high levels of H3K4me3 and are associated with highly expressed genes. We show that KDM5-activated genes include a large set of cell cycle regulators and that the KDM5s are necessary for mitotic clonal expansion in 3T3-L1 cells, indicating that KDM5 KD may interfere with differentiation in part by impairing proliferation. Notably, the demethylase activity of KDM5A is required for activation of at least a subset of pro-proliferative cell cycle genes. In conclusion, the KDM5 family acts as dual modulators of gene expression in preadipocytes and is required for early stage differentiation and activation of pro-proliferative cell cycle genes.},

abstract = {Histomorphological features of colorectal cancers (CRC) represent valuable prognostic indicators for clinical decision making. The invasive margin is a central feature for prognostication shaped by the complex processes governing tumor-host interaction. Assessment of the tumor border can be performed on standard paraffin sections and shows promise for integration into the diagnostic routine of gastrointestinal pathology. In aggressive CRC, an extensive dissection of host tissue is seen with loss of a clear tumor-host interface. This pattern, termed "infiltrative tumor border configuration" has been consistently associated with poor survival outcome and early disease recurrence of CRC-patients. In addition, infiltrative tumor growth is frequently associated with presence of adverse clinicopathological features and molecular alterations related to aggressive tumor behavior including BRAFV600 mutation. In contrast, a well-demarcated "pushing" tumor border is seen frequently in CRC-cases with low risk for nodal and distant metastasis. A pushing border is a feature frequently associated with mismatch-repair deficiency and can be used to identify patients for molecular testing. Consequently, assessment of the tumor border configuration as an additional prognostic factor is recommended by the AJCC/UICC to aid the TNM-classification. To promote the assessment of the tumor border configuration in standard practice, consensus criteria on the defining features and method of assessment need to be developed further and tested for inter-observer reproducibility. The development of a standardized quantitative scoring system may lay the basis for verification of the prognostic associations of the tumor growth pattern in multivariate analyses and clinical trials. This article provides a comprehensive review of the diagnostic features, clinicopathological associations, and molecular alterations associated with the tumor border configuration in early stage and advanced CRC.},

The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans.

abstract = {Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process which is aberrantly activated during cancer invasion and metastasis. Elevated expression of EMT-inducers like ZEB1 enables tumor cells to detach from the primary tumor and invade into the surrounding tissue. The main antagonist of ZEB1 in controlling EMT is the microRNA-200 family that is reciprocally linked to ZEB1 in a double negative feedback loop. Here, we further elucidate how the ZEB1/miR-200 feedback loop controls invasion of tumor cells. The process of EMT is attended by major changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Via in silico screening of genes encoding for actin interacting proteins, we identified two novel targets of miR-200c - TKS5 and MYLK (MLCK). Co-expression of both genes with ZEB1 was observed in several cancer cell lines as well as in breast cancer patients and correlated with low miR-200c levels. Depletion of TKS5 or MYLK in breast cancer cells reduced their invasive potential and their ability to form invadopodia. Whereas TKS5 is known to be a major component, we could identify MYLK as a novel player in invadopodia formation. In summary, TKS5 and MYLK represent two mediators of invasive behavior of cancer cells that are regulated by the ZEB1/miR-200 feedback loop.},

To understand these complex wiring diagrams, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism. This approach may help define the basic computational elements of other biological networks.},

In this study, we analyze the molecular heterogeneity of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using immuno-fluorescence microscopy. Unexpectedly, we only observe a small percentage of cells with high simultaneous expression of markers for adipogenesis (peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor $\gamma$ [PPAR$\gamma$], CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein $\alpha$, and adiponectin) and lipid accumulation (hormone-sensitive lipase, perilipin A, and LDs). Instead, we identify subpopulations of cells with negatively correlated expressions of these readouts. Acute perturbation of adipocyte differentiation with PPAR$\gamma$ agonists, forskolin, and fatty acids induced subpopulation-specific effects, including redistribution of the percentage of cells in observed subpopulations and differential expression levels of PPAR$\gamma$. Collectively, our results suggested that heterogeneity observed during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis reflects a dynamic mixture of subpopulations with distinct physiological states. {\textcopyright} 2009 Loo et al.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy is a conserved degradative pathway in which a double-membrane compartment sequesters cytoplasmic cargo and delivers the contents to lysosomes for degradation. Efficient formation and maturation of autophagic vesicles, so called phagophores that are precursors to autophagosomes, and their subsequent trafficking to lysosomes relies on the activity of small RAB GTPases, which are essential factors of cellular vesicle transport systems. The activity of RAB GTPases is coordinated by upstream factors, which include guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RAB GEFs) and RAB GTPase activating proteins (RAB GAPs). A role in macroautophagy regulation for different TRE2-BUB2-CDC16 (TBC) domain-containing RAB GAPs has been established. Recently, however, a positive modulation of macroautophagy has also been demonstrated for the TBC domain-free RAB3GAP1/2, adding to the family of RAB GAPs that coordinate macroautophagy and additional cellular trafficking pathways.},

abstract = { The field of anatomy, one of the most ancient sciences, first evolved in Egypt. From the Early Dynastic Period (3100 bc ) until the time of Galen at the end of the 2nd century ad , Egypt was the center of anatomical knowledge, including neuroanatomy. Knowledge of neuroanatomy first became important so that sacred rituals could be performed by ancient Egyptian embalmers during mummification procedures. Later, neuroanatomy became a science to be studied by wise men at the ancient temple of Memphis. As religious conflicts developed, the study of the human body became restricted. Myths started to replace scientific research, squelching further exploration of the human body until Alexander the Great founded the city of Alexandria. This period witnessed a revolution in the study of anatomy and functional anatomy. Herophilus of Chalcedon, Erasistratus of Chios, Rufus of Ephesus, and Galen of Pergamon were prominent physicians who studied at the medical school of Alexandria and contributed greatly to knowledge about the anatomy of the skull base. After the Royal Library of Alexandria was burned and laws were passed prohibiting human dissections based on religious and cultural factors, knowledge of human skull base anatomy plateaued for almost 1500 years. In this article the authors consider the beginning of this journey, from the earliest descriptions of skull base anatomy to the establishment of basic skull base anatomy in ancient Egypt. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) plays a critical role in tumor development by regulating cell functions such as invasion, apoptosis and differentiation. Down-regulation of RKIP expression has been implicated in the development and progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Herein, we hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in RKIP might be associated with susceptibility and progression of RCC.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A total of 5 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) in RKIP were selected and genotyped by SNapShot method in a case-control study of 859 RCC patients and 1004 controls. The logistic regression was used to evaluate the genetic association with occurrence and progression of RCC. The functionality of the important SNP was preliminary examined by qRT-PCR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULT: We found that the rs17512051 in the promoter region of RKIP was significantly associated with decreased clear cell RCC (ccRCC) risk (TA/AA vs. TT: P = 0.039, OR = 0.78, 95{\%}CI = 0.62-0.99). Another SNP (rs1051470) in the 3'UTR region of RKIP was marginally associated with increased ccRCC risk (TT vs. CC+CT: OR = 1.45, 95{\%}CI = 1.01-2.09). In the stratified analysis, the protective effect of rs17512051 was more predominant in the subgroups of male, non-smokers, non-drinkers as well as subjects without history of diabetes. Furthermore, we observed higher RKIP mRNA levels in the presence of the rs17512051A allele in normal renal tissues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the potentially functional RKIP rs17512051 polymorphism may affect ccRCC susceptibility through altering the endogenous RKIP expression level. Risk effects and the functional impact of this polymorphism need further validation.},

abstract = {Genetic variants in human microRNA (miRNA) genes may alter mature miRNA processing and/or target selection, and likely contribute to cancer susceptibility and disease progression. Previous studies have suggested that miR-101 may play important roles in the development of cancer by regulating key tumor-associated genes. However, the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of miR-101 in breast cancer susceptibility remains unclear. In this study, we genotyped 11 SNPs of the miR-101 genes (including miR-101-1 and miR-101-2) in a case-control study of 1064 breast cancer cases and 1073 cancer-free controls. The results revealed that rs462480 and rs1053872 in the flank regions of pre-miR-101-2 were significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer (rs462480 AC/CC vs AA: adjusted OR = 1.182, 95{\%} CI: 1.030-1.357, P = 0.017; rs1053872 CG/GG vs CC: adjusted OR = 1.179, 95{\%} CI: 1.040-1.337, P = 0.010). However, the remaining 9 SNPs were not significantly associated with risk of breast cancer. Additionally, combined analysis of the two high-risk SNPs revealed that subjects carrying the variant genotypes of rs462480 and rs1053872 had increased risk of breast cancer in a dose-response manner (P(trend) = 0.002). Compared with individuals with "0-1" risk allele, those carrying "2-4" risk alleles had 1.29-fold risk of breast cancer. In conclusion, these findings suggested that the SNPs rs462480 and rs1053872 residing in miR-101-2 gene may have a solid impact on genetic susceptibility to breast cancer, which may improve our understanding of the potential contribution of miRNA SNPs to cancer pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Backgound: The inability to detect premature atherosclerosis significantly hinders implementation of personalized therapy to prevent coronary heart disease. A comprehensive understanding of arterial protein networks and how they change in early atherosclerosis could identify new biomarkers for disease detection and improved therapeutic targets. Methods: Here we describe the human arterial proteome and proteomic features strongly associated with early atherosclerosis based on mass spectrometry analysis of coronary artery and aortic specimens from 100 autopsied young adults (200 arterial specimens). Convex analysis of mixtures, differential dependent network modeling, and bioinformatic analyses defined the composition, network rewiring, and likely regulatory features of the protein networks associated with early atherosclerosis and how they vary across 2 anatomic distributions. Results: The data document significant differences in mitochondrial protein abundance between coronary and aortic samples (coronary{\textgreater}{\textgreater}aortic), and between atherosclerotic and normal tissues (atherosclerotic{\textless}{\textless}normal), and major alterations in tumor necrosis factor, insulin receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\gamma$ protein networks, as well, in the setting of early disease. In addition, a subset of tissue protein biomarkers indicative of early atherosclerosis was shown to predict anatomically defined coronary atherosclerosis when measured in plasma samples in a separate clinical cohort (area under the curve=0.92 [0.83-0.96]), thereby validating the use of human tissue proteomics to discover relevant plasma biomarkers for clinical applications. In addition to the specific proteins and pathways identified here, the publicly available data resource and the analysis pipeline used illustrate a strategy for interrogating and interpreting the proteomic architecture of tissues that may be relevant for other chronic diseases characterized by multicellular tissue phenotypes. Conclusions: The human arterial proteome can be viewed as a complex network whose architectural features vary considerably as a function of anatomic location and the presence or absence of atherosclerosis. The data suggest important reductions in mitochondrial protein abundance in early atherosclerosis and also identify a subset of plasma proteins that are highly predictive of angiographically defined coronary disease.},

abstract = {The CSB protein, a member of the SWI/SNF ATP dependent chromatin remodeling family of proteins, plays a role in a sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) known as transcription coupled repair (TCR). CSB is frequently mutated in Cockayne syndrome group B, a segmental progeroid human autosomal recessive disease characterized by growth failure and degeneration of multiple organs. Though initially classified as a DNA repair protein, recent studies have demonstrated that the loss of CSB results in pleiotropic effects. Identification of novel proteins belonging to the CSB interactome may be useful not only for predicting the molecular basis for diverse pathological symptoms of CS-B patients but also for unraveling the functions of CSB in addition to its authentic role in DNA repair. In this study, we performed tandem affinity purification (TAP) technology coupled with mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation studies to identify and characterize the proteins that potentially interact with CSB-TAP. Our approach revealed 33 proteins that were not previously known to interact with CSB. These newly identified proteins indicate potential roles for CSB in RNA metabolism involving repression and activation of transcription process and in the maintenance of chromatin dynamics and integrity.},

abstract = {Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3)-regulated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) positively feeds back on tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced necroptosis, a type of programmed necrosis. Glutamine catabolism is known to contribute to RIP3-mediated ROS induction, but the major contributor is unknown. Here, we show that RIP3 activates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC, also known as PDH), the rate-limiting enzyme linking glycolysis to aerobic respiration, by directly phosphorylating the PDC E3 subunit (PDC-E3) on T135. Upon activation, PDC enhances aerobic respiration and subsequent mitochondrial ROS production. Unexpectedly, mixed-lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) is also required for the induction of aerobic respiration, and we further show that it is required for RIP3 translocation to meet mitochondria-localized PDC. Our data uncover a regulation mechanism of PDC activity, show that PDC activation by RIP3 is most likely the major mechanism activated by TNF to increase aerobic respiration and its by-product ROS, and suggest that RIP3-dependent induction of aerobic respiration contributes to pathologies related to oxidative stress.},

abstract = {To understand the molecular basis for the dramatic functional synergy between transcription factors that bind to the minimal T-cell receptor $\alpha$ enhancer (E$\alpha$), we analyzed enhancer occupancy in thymocytes of transgenic mice in vivo by genomic footprinting. We found that the formation of a multiprotein complex on this enhancer in vivo results from the occupancy of previously identified sites for CREB/ATF, TCF/LEF, CBF/PEBP2, and Ets factors as well as from the occupancy of two new sites 5′ of the CRE site, GC-I (which binds Sp1 in vitro) and GC-II. Significantly, although all sites are occupied on a wild-type E$\alpha$, all sites are unoccupied on versions of E$\alpha$ with mutations in the TCF/LEF or Ets sites. Previous in vitro experiments demonstrated hierarchical enhancer occupancy with independent binding of LEF-1 and CREB. Our data indicate that the formation of a multiprotein complex on the enhancer in vivo is highly cooperative and that no single E$\alpha$ binding factor can access chromatin in vivo to play a unique initiating role in its assembly. Rather, the simultaneous availability of multiple enhancer binding proteins is required for chromatin disruption and stable binding site occupancy as well as the activation of transcription and V(D)J recombination.},

In this study, for the first time, we have discovered that PVT1 shows higher expression in NPCs than in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial tissue, and patients with NPCs who show higher expression of PVT1 have worse progression-free and overall survivals. Additionally, we observed that the proliferation of NPC cells decreased, and their rate of apoptosis increased; these results indicated that the knockdown of PVT1 expression in the NPC cells induced radiosensitivity. Further, we have shown that the knockdown of PVT1 expression can induce apoptosis in the NPC cells by influencing the DNA damage repair pathway after radiotherapy. In general, our study shows that PVT1 may be a novel biomarker for prognosis and a new target for the treatment of NPCs. Additionally, targeting PVT1 may be a potential strategy for the clinical management of NPC and for the improvement of the curative effect of radiation in NPCs.},

The G protein-coupled receptor for thrombin can transactivate protein tyrosine kinase receptors (PTKR) and we have recently established that it can also transactivate serine/threonine kinase receptors (S/TKR). A comprehensive knowledge of the signalling pathways that GPCR transactivation elicits is necessary to fully understand the implications of both GPCR activation and the impact of target drugs. Here, we demonstrate that thrombin elicits dual transactivation-dependent signalling pathways to stimulate mRNA expression of glycosaminoglycan synthesizing enzymes chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase 1 and chondroitin sulfate synthase 1. The PTKR mediated response involves matrix metalloproteinases and the phosphorylation of the MAP kinase Erk. The S/TKR mediated response differs markedly and involves the phosphorylation of Smad2 carboxy terminal serine residues and does not involve matrix metalloproteinases. This work shows that all of the thrombin mediated signalling to glycosaminoglycan synthesizing enzyme gene expression occurs via transactivation-dependent pathways and does not involve transactivation-independent signalling. These findings highlight the complexity of thrombin-mediated transactivation signalling and the broader implications of GPCR targeted therapeutics.},

abstract = {The tumor microenvironment is abundant with exosomes that are secreted by the cancer cells themselves. Exosomes are nanosized, organelle-like membranous structures that are increasingly being recognized as major contributors in the progression of malignant neoplasms. A critical element in melanoma progression is its propensity to metastasize, but little is known about how melanoma cell-derived exosomes modulate the microenvironment to optimize conditions for tumor progression and metastasis. Here, we provide evidence that melanoma cell-derived exosomes promote phenotype switching in primary melanocytes through paracrine/autocrine signaling. We found that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was activated during the exosome-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-resembling process, which promotes metastasis. Let-7i, an miRNA modulator of EMT, was also involved in this process. We further defined two other miRNA modulators of EMT (miR-191 and let-7a) in serum exosomes for differentiating stage I melanoma patients from non-melanoma subjects. These results provide the first strong molecular evidence that melanoma cell-derived exosomes promote the EMT-resembling process in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, novel strategies targeting EMT and modulating the tumor microenvironment may emerge as important approaches for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Currently, a lack of consensus exists on how best to perform and interpret quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader's ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments. CONTENT The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement. SUMMARY Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.},

EMT contributes to chemoresistance, however, little is known about whether chemotherapy can induce EMT in cancer cells. Here, we found that miR-101 expression was downregulated in cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Restoration of miR-101 expression inhibited EMT and increased the sensitivity of cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells to cisplatin in vitro by targeting ROCK2. Furthermore, ROCK2 protein level was inversely correlated with miR-101 level in NSCLC tissue samples. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that low miR-101 expression in NSCLC was correlated with poor survival time. In summary, our results provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of miR-101/ROCK2 signaling in the cisplatin resistance of NSCLC cells. Targeting of miR-101 is a potential therapeutic approach for NSCLC.},

abstract = {While adipogenesis is controlled by a cascade of transcription factors, the global gene expression profiles in the early phase of adipogenesis are not well defined. Using microarray analysis of gene expression in 3T3-L1 cells, we have identified evidence for the activity of 2,568 genes during the early phase of adipocyte differentiation. One of these, the ISL1 gene, was of interest since its expression was markedly upregulated 1 h after initiation of differentiation, with a subsequent rapid decline. Overexpression of ISL1 at early times during adipocyte differentiation but not at later times was found to profoundly inhibit differentiation. This was accompanied by moderate downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) levels, substantial downregulation of PPAR$\gamma$ downstream genes, and downregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) levels in preadipocytes. Readdition of BMP4 overcame the inhibitory effect of ISL1 on the expression of PPAR$\gamma$ but not aP2, a gene downstream of PPAR$\gamma$, and BMP4 also partially rescued ISL1 inhibition of adipogenesis, an effect which is additive with rosiglitazone. These results suggest that ISL1 is intimately involved in early regulation of adipogenesis, modulating PPAR$\gamma$ expression and activity via BMP4-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our time course gene expression survey sets the stage for further studies to explore other early and immediate regulators.},

abstract = {Background: Modeling dynamic regulatory networks is a major challenge since much of the protein-DNA interaction data available is static. The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) uses a Hidden Markov Model-based approach to integrate this static interaction data with time series gene expression leading to models that can determine when transcription factors (TFs) activate genes and what genes they regulate. DREM has been used successfully in diverse areas of biological research. However, several issues were not addressed by the original version.Results: DREM 2.0 is a comprehensive software for reconstructing dynamic regulatory networks that supports interactive graphical or batch mode. With version 2.0 a set of new features that are unique in comparison with other softwares are introduced. First, we provide static interaction data for additional species. Second, DREM 2.0 now accepts continuous binding values and we added a new method to utilize TF expression levels when searching for dynamic models. Third, we added support for discriminative motif discovery, which is particularly powerful for species with limited experimental interaction data. Finally, we improved the visualization to support the new features. Combined, these changes improve the ability of DREM 2.0 to accurately recover dynamic regulatory networks and make it much easier to use it for analyzing such networks in several species with varying degrees of interaction information.Conclusions: DREM 2.0 provides a unique framework for constructing and visualizing dynamic regulatory networks.

abstract = {Trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12 CLA) causes fat loss in mouse white adipose tissue (WAT) and adipocytes in culture. The early transcriptome changes in treated WAT and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were analyzed using high-density microarrays to better characterize the signaling pathways responding to t10c12 CLA. Gene expression responses between 4 and 24 h after treatment showed a common set of early gene expression changes indicative of an integrated stress response (ISR). The responses of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes treated with t10c12 CLA or adipocytes treated with the cis-9, trans-11 isomer of CLA did not show the ISR, indicating the effect is specific to adipocytes responding to t10c12 CLA. Western blot analysis found increased phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha and increased production of ATF4 confirming at least part of the response to t10c12 CLA is mediated through the ISR pathway. Immunofluorescence microscopy found that the cell type expressing ATF3, an indicator of the ISR, was early stage adipocytes containing oil droplets but lacking the abundant levels of fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4) (AP2) found in mature adipocytes. Our data suggests that the ISR precedes and is possibly the cause of the later induction of proinflammatory cytokines observed in t10c12 CLA treated adipocytes. The release of proinflammatory cytokines may explain how the ISR in early stage adipocytes causes lipid loss in mature adipocytes.},

Exact diagnosis is mostly very late and advanced-stage NSCLCs are inoperable at admission. Tailored therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors are only available for a minority of patients. Thus, chemotherapy is often the treatment of choice. As first-line chemotherapy for NSCLCs, platinum-based substances (e.g. cisplatin, CDDP) are mainly used. Unfortunately, the positive effects of CDDP are frequently diminished due to development of drug resistance and negative influence of microenvironmental factors like hypoxia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression and modification of biological processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell response to chemotherapeutics. Expression of miRNAs is often deregulated in lung cancer compared to corresponding non-malignant tissue. In this review we summarize the present knowledge about the effects of miRNAs on CDDP-resistance in NSCLCs. Further, we focus on miRNAs deregulated by hypoxia, which is an important factor in the development of CDDP-resistance in NSCLCs. This review will contribute to the general understanding of miRNA-regulated biological processes in NSCLC, with special focus on the role of miRNA in CDDP-resistance.},

abstract = {ULK1 (unc-51 like kinase 1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a key role in regulating the induction of autophagy. Recent studies using autophagy-defective mouse models, such as atg5- or atg7-deficient mice, revealed an important function of autophagy in adipocyte differentiation. Suppression of adipogenesis in autophagy-defective conditions has made it difficult to study the roles of autophagy in metabolism of differentiated adipocytes. In this study, we established autophagy defective-differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and investigated the roles of Ulk1 and its close homolog Ulk2 in lipid and glucose metabolism using the established adipocytes. Through knockdown approaches, we determined that Ulk1 and Ulk2 are important for basal and MTORC1 inhibition-induced autophagy, basal lipolysis, and mitochondrial respiration. However, unlike other autophagy genes (Atg5, Atg13, Rb1cc1/Fip200, and Becn1) Ulk1 was dispensable for adipogenesis without affecting the expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ? (CEBPA) and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor gamma (PPARG). Ulk1 knockdown reduced fatty acid oxidation and enhanced fatty acid uptake, the metabolic changes that could contribute to adipogenesis, whereas Ulk2 knockdown had opposing effects. We also found that the expression levels of insulin receptor (INSR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), and glucose transporter 4 (SLC2A4/GLUT4) were increased in Ulk1-silenced adipocytes, which was accompanied by upregulation of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These results suggest that ULK1, albeit its important autophagic role, regulates lipid metabolism and glucose uptake in adipocytes distinctly from other autophagy proteins.},

In this review, we highlight the complicated interactive network comprised of different MMPs and their regulating microRNAs, as well as the ways in which these interactions influence cancer development, including tumor angiogenesis, growth, invasion, and metastasis. Based on the conclusive roles that microRNAs play in the regulation of MMPs during cancer progression, we discuss the potential use of microRNA-mediated MMP regulation in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors from the clinical perspective. In particular, microRNA-mediated MMP regulation may lead to the development of promising new MMP inhibitors that target MMPs more selectively, and this approach may also target multiple molecules in a network, leading to the efficient regulation of distinct biological processes relevant to malignant tumors. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying microRNA-mediated MMP regulation during tumor progression will help to provide new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors.},

In addition to energy-dissipating brown and beige adipocytes, recent lineage tracing studies have demonstrated that individual adipose depots are composed of white adipocytes that are derived from distinct precursor populations, giving rise to distinct subpopulations of energy-storing white adipocytes. In this review, we discuss this developmental and functional heterogeneity of white adipocytes both between and within adipose depots.

Metabolic plasticity is prominently exemplified by the enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT in response to cold exposure or $\beta$3-adrenergic stimulation. Here we show that these stimuli increase the levels of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in WAT of mice and that elevated LSD1 levels induce mitochondrial activity. Genome-wide binding and transcriptome analyses demonstrate that LSD1 directly stimulates the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cooperation with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1). In transgenic (Tg) mice, increased levels of LSD1 promote in a cell-autonomous manner the formation of islets of metabolically active brown-like adipocytes in WAT. Notably, Tg mice show limited weight gain when fed a high-fat diet. Taken together, our data establish LSD1 as a key regulator of OXPHOS and metabolic adaptation in WAT.},

Methods A total of 196 NSCLC patients were recruited in the study. Plasma sample and tumor tissue sample were collected. Total RNA was extracted from plasma and tissue samples, and microR-34a/b/c expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results MiR-34a and miR-34c in plasma were positively associated with that in tumor tissue (P{\textless}0.001 and P=0.001, respectively). Plasma miR-34a expression was negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.002), also tissue miR-34a expression was negatively associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.018). Furthermore, plasma miR-34a high expression was correlated with prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.011) and overall survival (OS) (P=0.011) compared to low expression, and plasma miR-34c high expression could predict longer DFS (P=0.038) than low expression, while no correlation of plasma miR-34b with DFS and OS was discovered. In terms of tissue sample, worse DFS was associated with miR-34a (P=0.002) and miR-34c (P=0.032) low expressions compared with high expressions, and miR-34a (P{\textless}0.001), as well as miR-34c (P=0.003) high expressions were associated with longer OS than low expressions. Plasma miR-34a was correlated with prolonged DFS and OS in univariate Cox model, while it could not independently predict DFS and OS of NSCLC patients in multivariate Cox model. Conclusions In conclusion, circulating miR-34a and miR-34c might be served as novel prognostic biomarkers in NSCLC patients.},

abstract = {Radial glial progenitors (RGPs) are responsible for producing nearly all neocortical neurons. To gain insight into the patterns of RGP division and neuron production, we quantitatively analyzed excitatory neuron genesis in the mouse neocortex using Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers, which provides single-cell resolution of progenitor division patterns and potential in vivo. We found that RGPs progress through a coherent program in which their proliferative potential diminishes in a predictable manner. Upon entry into the neurogenic phase, individual RGPs produce ∼8-9 neurons distributed in both deep and superficial layers, indicating a unitary output in neuronal production. Removal of OTX1, a transcription factor transiently expressed in RGPs, results in both deep- and superficial-layer neuron loss and a reduction in neuronal unit size. Moreover, ∼1/6 of neurogenic RGPs proceed to produce glia. These results suggest that progenitor behavior and histogenesis in the mammalian neocortex conform to a remarkably orderly and deterministic program.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, decreased striatal dopamine levels, and consequent extrapyramidal motor dysfunction. Recent evidence indicates that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is inappropriately activated in several neurodegenerative conditions, including PD. To date, strategies to specifically inhibit Cdk5 hyperactivity have not been successful without affecting normal Cdk5 activity. Previously we reported that TFP5 peptide has neuroprotective effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that TFP5/TP5 selective inhibition of Cdk5/p25 hyperactivation in vivo and in vitro rescues nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP/MPP+) in a mouse model of PD. TP5 peptide treatment also blocked dopamine depletion in the striatum and improved gait dysfunction after MPTP administration. The neuroprotective effect of TFP5/TP5 peptide is also associated with marked reduction in neuroinflammation and apoptosis. Here we show selective inhibition of Cdk5/p25 -hyperactivation by TFP5/TP5 peptide, which identifies the kinase as a potential therapeutic target to reduce neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.},

Thus, it constitutes a public health issue of major proportion. The expansion of adipose depots can be driven either by the increase in adipocyte size (hypertrophy) or by the formation of new adipocytes from precursor differentiation in the process of adipogenesis (hyperplasia). Notably, adipocyte expansion through adipogenesis can offset the negative metabolic effects of obesity, and the mechanisms and regulators of this adaptive process are now emerging. Over the past several years, we have learned a considerable amount about how adipocyte fate is determined and how adipogenesis is regulated by signalling and systemic factors. We have also gained appreciation that the adipogenic niche can influence tissue adipogenic capability. Approaches aimed at increasing adipogenesis over adipocyte hypertrophy can now be explored as a means to treat metabolic diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the association between excision repair cross-complementing group 6 (ERCC6) gene polymorphisms and bladder cancer risk, but their findings have been inconsistent. Here we performed a meta-analysis to attempt to clarify this association. METHODS Studies were retrieved from the PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases up to October 1, 2015, with strict selection and exclusion criteria. A total of 5,032 samples, comprising samples from 2,475 bladder cancer patients and 2,557 controls from 5 studies, were included in the meta-analysis. The odds ratio (OR) with 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate the strength of the associations. RESULTS Regarding the Met1097Val polymorphism, no significant association with bladder cancer risk was found in any of the genetic models evaluated (Val vs. Met: OR = 1.10, 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.25; Val/Val vs. Met/Met: OR = 1.23, 95{\%} CI, 0.86-1.75; Val/Val + Val/Met vs. Met/Met: OR = 1.12, 95{\%} CI, 0.96-1.30; Val/Val vs. Met/Met + Val/Met: OR = 0.81, 95{\%} CI, 0.57-1.14). Similarly, as regards the Arg1230Pro polymorphism, we also found no positive results. CONCLUSIONS According to the results of our meta-analysis, there is no evidence of a link between the ERCC6 gene polymorphisms and bladder cancer risk. Well-designed further studies, with larger sample sizes and adjustment for confounders such as smoking status, are needed to confirm these conclusions.},

abstract = {The PI3-kinase pathway is commonly activated in tumors, most often by loss of PTEN lipid phosphatase activity or the amplification or mutation of p110$\alpha$. Oncogenic mutants have commonly been found in p110$\alpha$, but rarely in any of the other catalytic subunits of class I PI3-kinases. We here characterize a p110$\beta$ helical domain mutation, E633K, first identified in a Her2-positive breast cancer. The mutation increases basal p110$\beta$ activity, but does not affect activation of p85/p110$\beta$ dimers by phosphopeptides or G$\beta$$\gamma$. Expression of the mutant causes increases in Akt and S6K1 activation, transformation, chemotaxis, proliferation and survival in low serum. E633 is conserved among class I PI3 Ks, and its mutation in p110$\beta$ is also activating. Interestingly, the E633K mutant occurs near a region that interacts with membranes in activated PI 3-kinases, and its mutation abrogates the requirement for an intact Ras-binding domain in p110$\beta$-mediated transformation. We propose that the E633K mutant activates p110$\beta$ by enhancing its basal association with membranes. This study presents the first analysis of an activating oncogenic mutation of p110$\beta$.},

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so—and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

abstract = {SH2 domains are long known prominent players in the field of phosphotyrosine recognition within signaling protein networks. However, over the years they have been joined by an increasing number of other protein domain families that can, at least with some of their members, also recognise pTyr residues in a sequence-specific context. This superfamily of pTyr recognition modules, which includes substantial fractions of the PTB domains, as well as much smaller, or even single member fractions like the HYB domain, the PKC$\delta$ and PKC$\theta$ C2 domains and RKIP, represents a fascinating, medically relevant and hence intensely studied part of the cellular signaling architecture of metazoans. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation clearly serves a plethora of functions and pTyr recognition domains are used in a similarly wide range of interaction modes, which encompass, for example, partner protein switching, tandem recognition functionalities and the interaction with catalytically active protein domains. If looked upon closely enough, virtually no pTyr recognition and regulation event is an exact mirror image of another one in the same cell. Thus, the more we learn about the biology and ultrastructural details of pTyr recognition domains, the more does it become apparent that nature cleverly combines and varies a few basic principles to generate a sheer endless number of sophisticated and highly effective recognition/regulation events that are, under normal conditions, elegantly orchestrated in time and space. This knowledge is also valuable when exploring pTyr reader domains as diagnostic tools, drug targets or therapeutic reagents to combat human diseases.},

The methylation of Lys4 of histone H3 seems to be of particular significance. It is associated with active regions of the genome, and in Drosophila it is catalyzed by trithorax-group proteins that have become paradigms of developmental regulators at the level of chromatin. Like other histone methylation events, H3K4 methylation was considered irreversible until the identification of a large number of histone demethylases indicated that demethylation events play an important role in histone modification dynamics. However, the described demethylases had no strictly assigned biological functions and the identity of the histone demethylases that would contribute to the epigenetic changes specifying certain biological processes was unknown. Recently, several groups presented evidence that a family of 4 JmjC domain proteins results in the global changes of histone demethylation, and in elegant studies using model organisms, they demonstrated the importance of this family of histone demethylases in cell fate determination. All 4 proteins possess the demethylase activity specific to H3K4 and belong to the poorly described JARID1 protein family.},

abstract = {THE MERGING OF NETWORK THEORY AND MICROARRAY DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES HAS SPAWNED A NEW FIELD: gene coexpression network analysis. While network methods are increasingly used in biology, the network vocabulary of computational biologists tends to be far more limited than that of, say, social network theorists. Here we review and propose several potentially useful network concepts. We take advantage of the relationship between network theory and the field of microarray data analysis to clarify the meaning of and the relationship among network concepts in gene coexpression networks. Network theory offers a wealth of intuitive concepts for describing the pairwise relationships among genes, which are depicted in cluster trees and heat maps. Conversely, microarray data analysis techniques (singular value decomposition, tests of differential expression) can also be used to address difficult problems in network theory. We describe conditions when a close relationship exists between network analysis and microarray data analysis techniques, and provide a rough dictionary for translating between the two fields. Using the angular interpretation of correlations, we provide a geometric interpretation of network theoretic concepts and derive unexpected relationships among them. We use the singular value decomposition of module expression data to characterize approximately factorizable gene coexpression networks, i.e., adjacency matrices that factor into node specific contributions. High and low level views of coexpression networks allow us to study the relationships among modules and among module genes, respectively. We characterize coexpression networks where hub genes are significant with respect to a microarray sample trait and show that the network concept of intramodular connectivity can be interpreted as a fuzzy measure of module membership. We illustrate our results using human, mouse, and yeast microarray gene expression data. The unification of coexpression network methods with traditional data mining methods can inform the application and development of systems biologic methods.},

The aim of the present work was to update the different animal and human cell culture models available for studying the in vitro adipogenic differentiation process related to obesity and its co-morbidities. The main characteristics, new protocols, and applications of the cell models used to study the adipogenesis in the last five years have been extensively revised.

In the era of precision medicine, it is essential to predict and to prevent the spread of cancer cells to significantly improve patient survival. Thanks to the application of a variety of high-throughput technologies, accumulating big data enables researchers and clinicians to identify aggressive tumors as well as patients with a high risk of cancer metastasis. However, there have been few large-scale gene collection studies to enable metastasis-related analyses. In the last several years, emerging efforts have identified pro-metastatic genes in a variety of cancers, providing us the ability to generate a pro-metastatic gene cluster for big data analyses. We carefully selected 285 genes with in vivo evidence of promoting metastasis reported in the literature. These genes have been investigated in different tumor types. We used two datasets downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, specifically, datasets of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, for validation tests, and excluded any genes for which elevated expression level correlated with longer overall survival in any of the datasets. Ultimately, 150 pro-metastatic genes remained in our analyses. We believe this collection of pro-metastatic genes will be helpful for big data analyses, and eventually will accelerate anti-metastasis research and clinical intervention.},

abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE Ewan Cameron reported that ascorbate, given orally and intravenously at doses of up to 10 g/day, was effective in the treatment of cancer. Double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials showed no survival advantage when the same doses of ascorbate were given orally, leading the medical and scientific communities to dismiss the use of ascorbate as a potential cancer treatment. However, the route of administration results in major differences in ascorbate bioavailability. Tissue and plasma concentrations are tightly controlled in response to oral administration, but this can be bypassed by intravenous administration. These data provide a plausible scientific rationale for the absence of a response to orally administered ascorbate in the Mayo clinic trials and indicate the need to reassess ascorbate as a cancer therapeutic. RECENT ADVANCES High dose ascorbate is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cell lines through the generation of extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Murine xenograft models confirm a growth inhibitory effect of pharmacological concentrations. The safety of intravenous ascorbate has been verified in encouraging pilot clinical studies. CRITICAL ISSUES Neither the selective toxicity of pharmacologic ascorbate against cancer cells nor the mechanism of H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity is fully understood. Despite promising preclinical data, the question of clinical efficacy remains. FUTURE DIRECTIONS A full delineation of mechanism is of interest because it may indicate susceptible cancer types. Effects of pharmacologic ascorbate used in combination with standard treatments need to be defined. Most importantly, the clinical efficacy of ascorbate needs to be reassessed using proper dosing, route of administration, and controls.},

Adipogenesis of human SBGS pre-adipocyte cells in vitro was monitored with a transcriptomic data set comprising six time points (0, 6, 48, 96, 192, 384 hours). To elucidate the mechanisms of adipogenesis, NASFinder was used to perform time-point analysis by comparing each time point against the control (0 h) and time-lapse analysis by comparing each time point with the previous one. NASFinder identified the coordinated activity of seemingly unrelated processes between each comparison, providing the first systems view of adipogenesis in culture.

Furthermore, epigenetic alterations in tumor cells, including DNA methylation, as well as activation or suppression of histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and other chromatin-modifying enzymes, can further distort the transcriptional network to influence metastasis.

Ric-8A, G$\alpha$i subunits, and their regulators are localized at the midbody prior to abscission and linked to the final stages of cell division. Here, we identify a molecular mechanism by which Ric-8A affects cytokinesis and abscission by controlling Vps34 activity. We showed that Ric-8A protein expression is post-transcriptionally controlled during the cell cycle reaching its maximum levels at mitosis. A FRET biosensor created to measure conformational changes in Ric-8A by FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) revealed that Ric-8A was in a close-state during mitosis and particularly so at cytokinesis. Lowering Ric-8A expression delayed the abscission time of dividing cells, which correlated with increased intercellular bridge length and multinucleation. During cytokinesis, Ric-8A co-localized with Vps34 at the midbody along with G$\alpha$i and LGN, where these proteins functioned to regulate Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity.},

abstract = {Deguelin is known to suppress the growth of cancer cells; however, its anti-metastatic effects have not been studied so far in any cancer model. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-metastatic potential of deguelin in vivo and in tumor growth factor-$\beta$1 (TGF$\beta$1)-stimulated cells. Our results demonstrate that tumor growth, peritoneal dissemination and liver/lung metastasis of orthotopically implanted PanC-1-luc cells were significantly reduced in deguelin-treated mice along with the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, deguelin-treated tumors showed increased epithelial signature such as increased expression of E-Cadherin and cytokeratin-18 and decreased expression of Snail. Similar observations were made when PanC-1, COLO-357 and L3.6pl cells were treated in vitro with deguelin. Moreover, E-cadherin was transcriptionally upregulated and accumulated in the membrane fraction of deguelin-treated cells, as indicated by increased interaction of E-Cadherin with $\beta$-catenin. TGF$\beta$1-induced downregulation of E-Cadherin and upregulation of Snail were abrogated by deguelin treatment. In addition, deguelin inhibited TGF$\beta$1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and Smad4 nuclear translocation in PanC-1 cells. Furthermore, when TGF$\beta$1-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF$\kappa$B) activation was inhibited, TGF$\beta$1-induced Snail upregulation or E-Cadherin downregulation was blocked. Deguelin also significantly downregulated the constitutive phosphorylation and DNA binding of NF$\kappa$B in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, overexpression of either NF$\kappa$B or Snail completely abrogated deguelin-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inhibition, whereas overexpression of NF$\kappa$B but not Snail rescued cells from deguelin-induced apoptosis. Hence, deguelin targets NF$\kappa$B to induce reversal of EMT and apoptosis but downstream effectors might be different for both processes. Taken together, our results suggest that deguelin suppresses both pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting EMT.},

abstract = {Defective mitochondria exert deleterious effects on host cells. To manage this risk, mitochondria display several lines of quality control mechanisms: mitochondria-specific chaperones and proteases protect against misfolded proteins at the molecular level, and fission/fusion and mitophagy segregate and eliminate damage at the organelle level. An increase in unfolded proteins in mitochondria activates a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) to increase chaperone production, while the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase PARK2/Parkin, whose mutations cause familial Parkinson disease, remove depolarized mitochondria through mitophagy. It is unclear, however, if there is a connection between those different levels of quality control (QC). Here, we show that the expression of unfolded proteins in the matrix causes the accumulation of PINK1 on energetically healthy mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial translocation of PARK2, mitophagy and subsequent reduction of unfolded protein load. Also, PINK1 accumulation is greatly enhanced by the knockdown of the LONP1 protease. We suggest that the accumulation of unfolded proteins in mitochondria is a physiological trigger of mitophagy.},

We temporally uncoupled the activities of the four DIM components and found that treatment with dex for 48 h followed by IBMX treatment for 48 h was sufficient for adipogenesis, whereas treatment with IBMX followed by dex failed to induce significant differentiation. Similar results were obtained with C3H10T1/2 and primary mesenchymal stem cells. The 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated by sequential treatment with dex and IBMX displayed insulin sensitivity equivalent to DIM adipocytes, but had lower sensitivity to ISO-stimulated lipolysis and reduced triglyceride content. The nondifferentiating IBMX-then-dex treatment produced transient expression of adipogenic transcriptional regulatory factors C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta, and little induction of terminal differentiation factors C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma. Moreover, the adipogenesis inhibitor preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) was repressed by DIM or by dex-then-IBMX, but not by IBMX-then-dex treatment. We conclude that glucocorticoids drive preadipocytes to a novel intermediate cellular state, the dex-primed preadipocyte, during adipogenesis in cell culture, and that Pref-1 repression may be a cell fate determinant in preadipocytes.},

The random selection approach is now reaching a saturation point, and a transition to protocols targeted at the missing transcripts is now required to complete the mouse and human collections. Comparison of the sequence of the MGC clones to reference genome sequences reveals that most cDNA clones are of very high sequence quality, although it is likely that some cDNAs may carry missense variants as a consequence of experimental artifact, such as PCR, cloning, or reverse transcriptase errors. Recently, a rat cDNA component was added to the project, and ongoing frog (Xenopus) and zebrafish (Danio) cDNA projects were expanded to take advantage of the high-throughput MGC pipeline.},

The key molecules involved in metastatic progression and its early detection require clarification. The present study defines a seminal role of the metastasis-associated gene MDA-9/Syntenin in UCC progression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression pattern of MDA-9/Syntenin was examined in 44 primary UCC and the impact of its overexpression and knock down was examined in multiple cells lines and key findings were validated in primary tumors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Significantly higher (p= 0.002-0.003) expression of MDA-9/Syntenin was observed in 64{\%} (28/44) of primary tumors and an association was evident with stage (p=0.01), grade (p=0.03) and invasion status (p=0.02). MDA-9/Syntenin overexpression in non-tumorigenic HUC-1 cells increased proliferation (p=0.0012), invasion (p=0.0001) and EGFR, AKT, PI3K and c-Src expression. Alteration of Beta-catenin, E-Cadherin, Vimentin, Claudin-1, ZO-1 and TCF4 expression were also observed. MDA-9/Syntenin knock down in 3 UCC cell lines reversed phenotypic and molecular changes observed in the HUC-1 cells and reduced in vivo metastasis. Key molecular changes observed in the cell lines were confirmed in primary tumors. A physical interaction and co-localization of MDA-9/Syntenin and EGFR was evident in UCC cell lines and primary tumors. A logistic regression model analysis revealed a significant correlation between MDA-9/Syntenin:EGFR and MDA-9/Syntenin:AKT expressions with stage (p=0.04, EGFR), (p=0.01, AKT). A correlation between MDA-9/Syntenin:{\ss}-catenin co-expression with stage (p=0.03) and invasion (p=0.04) was also evident.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that MDA-9/Syntenin might provide an attractive target for developing detection, monitoring and therapeutic strategies for managing UCC.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Prostate carcinoma (PRAD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies amongst men worldwide. It is well-known that androgen receptor (AR) plays a pivotal role in a vast majority of prostate tumors. However, recent evidence emerged stating that estrogen receptors (ERs) may also contribute to prostate tumor development. Moreover, progression and aggressiveness of prostate cancer may be associated with differential expression genes of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore we aimed to assess the significance of receptors status as well as EMT marker genes expression among PRAD patients in accordance to their age and Gleason score. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed TCGA gene expression profiles of 497 prostate tumor samples according to 43 genes involved in EMT and 3 hormone receptor genes (AR, ESR1, ESR2) as well as clinical characteristic of cancer patients. Then patients were divided into four groups according to their age and 5 groups according to Gleason score. Next, we evaluated PRAD samples according to relationship between the set of variables in different combinations and compared differential expression in subsequent groups of patients. The analysis was applied using R packages: FactoMineR, gplots, RColorBrewer and NMF. RESULTS MFA analysis resulted in distinct grouping of PRAD patients into four age categories according to expression level of AR, ESR1 and ESR2 with the most distinct group of age less than 50 years old. Further investigations indicated opposite expression profiles of EMT markers between different age groups as well as strong association of EMT gene expression with Gleason score. We found that depending on age of prostate cancer patients and Gleason score EMT genes with distinctly altered expression are: KRT18, KRT19, MUC1 and COL4A1, CTNNB1, SNAI2, ZEB1 and MMP3. CONCLUSIONS Our major observation is that prostate cancer from patients under 50 years old compared to older ones has entirely different EMT gene expression profiles showing potentially more aggressive invasive phenotype, despite Gleason score classification.},

We devised a direct biochemical method for miRNA target discovery that combined RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) purification with microarray analysis of bound mRNAs. Because targets of miR-124a have been analyzed, we chose it as our model. We honed our approach both by examining the determinants of stable binding between RISC and synthetic target RNAs in vitro and by determining the dependency of both repression and RISC coimmunoprecipitation on miR-124a seed sites in two of its well characterized targets in vivo. Examining the complete spectrum of miR-124 targets in 293 cells yielded both a set that were down-regulated at the mRNA level, as previously observed, and a set whose mRNA levels were unaffected by miR-124a. Reporter assays validated both classes, extending the spectrum of mRNA targets that can be experimentally linked to the miRNA pathway.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress plays a fundamental role in many conditions. Specifically, redox imbalance inhibits endothelial cell (EC) growth, inducing cell death and senescence. We used global transcriptome profiling to investigate the involvement of noncoding-RNAs in these phenotypes. By RNA-sequencing, transcriptome changes were analyzed in human ECs exposed to H2O2, highlighting a pivotal role of p53-signaling. Bioinformatic analysis and validation in p53-silenced ECs, identified several p53-targets among both mRNAs and long noncoding-RNAs (lncRNAs), including MALAT1 and NEAT1. Among microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-192-5p was the most induced by H2O2 treatment, in a p53-dependent manner. Down-modulated mRNA-targets of miR-192-5p were involved in cell cycle, DNA repair and stress response. Accordingly, miR-192-5p overexpression significantly decreased EC proliferation, inducing cell death. A central role of the p53-pathway was also confirmed by the analysis of differential exon usage: Upon H2O2 treatment, the expression of p53-dependent 5'-isoforms of MDM2 and PVT1 increased selectively. The transcriptomic alterations identified in H2O2-treated ECs were also observed in other physiological and pathological conditions where redox control plays a fundamental role, such as ECs undergoing replicative senescence, skeletal muscles of critical limb-ischemia patients and the peripheral-blood mononuclear cells of long-living individuals. Collectively, these findings indicate a prominent role of noncoding-RNAs in oxidative stress response.},

Here, a single-cell approach is employed to investigate non-mutative causes of phenotypic heterogeneity during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into fat cells. Using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy and flow cytometry, adipogenic gene expression, insulin signaling, and glucose import are visualized simultaneously with lipid droplet accumulation in single cells. Expression of adipogenic genes PPAR$\gamma$, C/EBP$\alpha$, aP2, LP2 suggests a commitment to fat cell differentiation in all cells. However, the lack of lipid droplet in many differentiating cells suggests adipogenic gene expression is insufficient for lipid droplet formation. Instead, cell-to-cell variability in lipid droplet formation is dependent on the cascade responses of an insulin signaling pathway which includes insulin sensitivity, kinase activity, glucose import, expression of an insulin degradation enzyme, and insulin degradation rate. Increased and prolonged insulin stimulation promotes lipid droplet accumulation in all differentiating cells. Single-cell profiling reveals the kinetics of an insulin signaling cascade as the origin of phenotypic variability in drug-inducible adipogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Le, Cheng.},

Transcription factors, some of which bind to specific DNA sequences, generally either activate or repress promoter activity and thereby control transcription initiation. Recent work has revealed in molecular detail some of the mechanisms used by transcription factors to bring about transcriptional repression. Some transcriptional repressor proteins counteract the activity of positively acting transcription factors. Other repressors inhibit the basal transcription machinery. In addition, the repression of transcription is often intimately associated with chromatin re-organisation. Many transcriptional repressor proteins interact either directly or indirectly with proteins that remodel chromatin or can themselves influence chromatin structure.

abstract = {Alternative usage of exons provides genomes with plasticity to produce different transcripts from the same gene, modulating the function, localization, and life cycle of gene products. It affects most human genes. For a limited number of cases, alternative functions and tissue-specific roles are known. However, recent high-throughput sequencing studies have suggested that much alternative isoform usage across tissues is nonconserved, raising the question of the extent of its functional importance. We address this question in a genome-wide manner by analyzing the transcriptomes of five tissues for six primate species, focusing on exons that are 1:1 orthologous in all six species. Our results support a model in which differential usage of exons has two major modes: First, most of the exons show only weak differences, which are dominated by interspecies variability and may reflect neutral drift and noisy splicing. These cases dominate the genome-wide view and explain why conservation appears to be so limited. Second, however, a sizeable minority of exons show strong differences between tissues, which are mostly conserved. We identified a core set of 3,800 exons from 1,643 genes that show conservation of strongly tissue-dependent usage patterns from human at least to macaque. This set is enriched for exons encoding protein-disordered regions and untranslated regions. Our findings support the theory that isoform regulation is an important target of evolution in primates, and our method provides a powerful tool for discovering potentially functional tissue-dependent isoforms.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, paternally provided organelles, including mitochondria, are eliminated by a process of selective autophagy called allophagy, the mechanism by which mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally. However, it remains unclear how paternal organelles are recognized and targeted for autophagy. Here, we identified an autophagy receptor for allophagy, ALLO-1. ALLO-1 is essential for autophagosome formation around paternal organelles and directly binds to the worm LC3 homologue LGG-1 through its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif. After fertilization, ALLO-1 accumulates on the paternal organelles before autophagosome formation, and this localization depends on the ubiquitin modification of the paternal organelles. We also identified IKKE-1, a worm homologue of the TBK1 and IKKϵ family kinase, as another critical regulator of allophagy. IKKE-1 interacts with ALLO-1, and the IKKE-1-dependent phosphorylation of ALLO-1 is important for paternal organelle clearance. Thus, we propose that ALLO-1 is the allophagy receptor whose function is regulated by IKKE-1-dependent phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved degradation pathway characterized by dynamic rearrangement of membranes that sequester cytoplasm, protein aggregates, organelles, and pathogens for delivery to the vacuole and lysosome, respectively. The ability of autophagosomal membranes to act selectively toward specific cargo is dependent on the small ubiquitin-like modifier ATG8/LC3 and the LC3-interacting region (LIR) present in autophagy receptors. Here, we describe a comprehensive protein-protein interaction analysis of TBC (Tre2, Bub2, and Cdc16) domain-containing Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) as potential autophagy adaptors. We identified 14 TBC domain-containing Rab GAPs that bind directly to ATG8 modifiers and that colocalize with LC3-positive autophagy membranes in cells. Intriguingly, one of our screening hits, TBC1D5, contains two LIR motifs. The N-terminal LIR was critical for interaction with the retromer complex and transport of cargo. Direct binding of the retromer component VPS29 to TBC1D5 could be titrated out by LC3, indicating a molecular switch between endosomes and autophagy. Moreover, TBC1D5 could bridge the endosome and autophagosome via its C-terminal LIR motif. During starvation-induced autophagy, TBC1D5 was relocalized from endosomal localization to the LC3-positive autophagosomes. We propose that LC3-interacting Rab GAPs are implicated in the reprogramming of the endocytic trafficking events under starvation-induced autophagy.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a cellular defense response to stress conditions, such as nutrient starvation. The type III phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase, whose catalytic subunit is PIK3C3/VPS34, plays a critical role in intracellular membrane trafficking and autophagy induction. PIK3C3 forms multiple complexes and the ATG14-containing PIK3C3 is specifically involved in autophagy induction. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) complex 1, MTORC1, is a key cellular nutrient sensor and integrator to stimulate anabolism and inhibit catabolism. Inactivation of TORC1 by nutrient starvation plays a critical role in autophagy induction. In this report we demonstrated that MTORC1 inactivation is critical for the activation of the autophagy-specific (ATG14-containing) PIK3C3 kinase, whereas it has no effect on ATG14-free PIK3C3 complexes. MTORC1 inhibits the PtdIns 3-kinase activity of ATG14-containing PIK3C3 by phosphorylating ATG14, which is required for PIK3C3 inhibition by MTORC1 both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest a mechanistic link between amino acid starvation and autophagy induction via the direct activation of the autophagy-specific PIK3C3 kinase.},

abstract = {Background and aim: Hyperglycemia-mediated oxidative stress impedes cell-repara-tive process like autophagy, which has been implicated in impairment of $\beta$-cell function in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the role of mitophagy (selective mitochon-drial autophagy) in progression of hyperglycemia remains elusive. This study aimed to assess the impact of increasing severity of hyperglycemia on mitochondrial stress and mitophagy. Design and methods: A case-control study included healthy controls, subjects with prediabetes, newly diagnosed T2DM (NDT2DM) and advanced duration of T2DM (ADT2DM) (n = 20 each). Mitochondrial stress indices, transcriptional and translational expression of mitophagy markers (PINK1, PARKIN, MFN2, NIX, LC3-II, and LAMP-2) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. results: With mild hyperglycemia in subjects with prediabetes, to moderate to severe hyperglycemia in NDT2DM and ADT2DM, a progressive rise in mitochondrial oxidative stress was observed. Prediabetic subjects exhibited significantly increased expression of mitophagy-related markers and showed a positive association with HOMA-$\beta$, whereas, patients with NDT2DM and ADT2DM demonstrated decreased expression, with a greater decline in ADT2DM subjects. TEM studies revealed significantly reduced number of distorted mitochondria in prediabetics, as compared to the T2DM patients. In addition, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed HbA1C {\textgreater} 7{\%} (53 mmol/mol) was associated with attenuated mitophagy. conclusion: Increasing hyperglycemia is associated with progressive rise in oxidative stress and altered mitochondrial morphology. Sustenance of mitophagy at HbA1C {\textless} 7{\%} (53 mmol/mol) strengthens the rationale of achieving HbA1C below this cutoff for good glycemic control. An "adaptive" increase in mitophagy may delay progression to T2DM by preserving the $\beta$-cell function in subjects with prediabetes.

abstract = {In human colorectal DLD1 cancer cells, the dietary bioflavonoid resveratrol (RV) rapidly induced autophagy. This effect was reversible (on removal of the drug) and was associated with increased expression and cytosolic redistribution of the proteins Beclin1 and LC3 II. Supplementing the cells with asparagine (Asn) abrogated the Beclin-dependent autophagy. When applied acutely (2 h), RV was not toxic; however, reiterate chronic (48 h) exposure to RV eventually led to annexin V- and terminal deoxinucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cell death. This toxic effect was autophagy dependent, as it was prevented either by Asn, by expressing a dominant-negative lipid kinase-deficient class III phosphoinositide 3-phosphate kinase, or by RNA interference knockdown of Beclin1. Lamp2b silencing abolished the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and preserved cell viability despite the ongoing formation of autophagosomes in cells chronically exposed to RV. The pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone inhibited RV-induced cell death, but not autophagy. These results uncover a novel pathway of RV cytotoxicity in which autophagy plays a dual role: (i) at first, it acts as a prosurvival stress response and (ii) at a later time, it switches to a caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway. The present data also indicate that genetic or epigenetic inactivation of autophagy proteins in cancer cells may confer resistance to RV-mediated killing.},

abstract = {The retromer complex is required for the efficient endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of the CIMPR, sortilin, SORL1, wntless and other physiologically important membrane proteins. Retromer comprises two protein complexes that act together in endosome-to-Golgi retrieval; the cargo-selective complex is a trimer of VPS35, VPS29 and VPS26 that sorts cargo into tubules for retrieval to the Golgi. Tubules are produced by the oligomerization of sorting nexin dimers. Here, we report the identification of five endosomally-localised proteins that modulate tubule formation and are recruited to the membrane via interactions with the cargo-selective retromer complex. One of the retromer-interacting proteins, strumpellin, is mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia, a progressive length-dependent axonopathy. Here, we show that strumpellin regulates endosomal tubules as part of a protein complex with three other proteins that include WASH1, an actin-nucleating promoting factor. Therefore, in addition to a direct role in endosome-to-Golgi retrieval, the cargo-selective retromer complex also acts as a platform for recruiting physiologically important proteins to endosomal membranes that regulate membrane tubule dynamics.},

abstract = {Cross-talk between DNA methylation and histone modifications drives the establishment of composite epigenetic signatures and is traditionally studied using correlative rather than direct approaches. Here, we present sequential ChIP-bisulfite-sequencing (ChIP-BS-seq) as an approach to quantitatively assess DNA methylation patterns associated with chromatin modifications or chromatin-associated factors directly. A chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-capturing step is used to obtain a restricted representation of the genome occupied by the epigenetic feature of interest, for which a single-base resolution DNA methylation map is then generated. When applied to H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), we found that H3K27me3 and DNA methylation are compatible throughout most of the genome, except for CpG islands, where these two marks are mutually exclusive. Further ChIP-BS-seq-based analysis in Dnmt triple-knockout (TKO) embryonic stem cells revealed that total loss of CpG methylation is associated with alteration of H3K27me3 levels throughout the genome: H3K27me3 in localized peaks is decreased while broad local enrichments (BLOCs) of H3K27me3 are formed. At an even broader scale, these BLOCs correspond to regions of high DNA methylation in wild-type ES cells, suggesting that DNA methylation prevents H3K27me3 deposition locally and at a megabase scale. Our strategy provides a unique way of investigating global interdependencies between DNA methylation and other chromatin features.},

Aberrant expression of miR-378 has been found in some types of cancer. However, effects and potential mechanisms of miR-378 in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been explored.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to evaluate miR-378 levels in CRC cell lines and 84 pairs of CRC cancer and normal adjacent mucosa. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression analyses were utilized to determine the association of miR-378 expression with survival of patients. MTT and invasion assays were used to determine the role of miR-378 in regulation of CRC cancer cell growth and invasion, respectively. Tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of cells into BALB/c nude mice. Luciferase assay was performed to assess miR-378 binding to vimentin gene.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this study, we confirmed that miR-378 significantly down-regulated in CRC cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, patients with low miR-378 expression had significantly poorer overall survival, and miR-378 expression was an independent prognostic factor in CRC. Over-expression of miR-378 inhibited SW620 cell growth and invasion, and resulted in down-regulation of vimentin expression. However, miR-378 knock-down promoted these processes and enhanced the expression of vimentin. In addition, we further identified vimentin as the functional downstream target of miR-378 by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of vimentin.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, miR-378 may function as a tumor suppressor and plays an important role in inhibiting tumor growth and invasion.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. BACKGROUND: Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) is rate limiting for the conversion of saturated fatty acids palmitate (16:0) and stearate (18:0) to monounsaturated fatty acids palmitoleate (16:1n7) and oleate (18:1n9), respectively. Given that reduced SCD1 activity is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and decreased body weight, there is considerable interest to elucidate the role of this enzyme in adipocytes. During adipogenesis, SCD1 levels increase concomitantly with the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TG); however, the extent to which reduced SCD1 activity can in fluence TG synthesis and metabolic pathways in differentiating adipocytes remains relatively unexplored. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to delineate how reduced SCD1 activity affects gene expression, protein content and cellular fatty acids in differentiating murine preadipocytes. METHODS: 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with an SCD1 inhibitor (10 nM) throughout differentiation. After 7 days, global gene expression, protein content and fatty acid profiles were examined using microarrays, western blotting and gas chromatography, respectively. RESULTS: SCD1 inhibition increased the abundance of 16:0 and 18:0 (45{\%} and 194{\%}, respectively) and decreased 16:1n7 and 18:1n7 (61{\%} and 35{\%}, respectively) in differentiated preadipocytes. Interestingly, 18:1n9 levels increased by 61{\%}. The augmented 18:0 suggested a possible increase in elongase activity. Elongase 6 ( Elovl6) gene expression was increased 2.8-fold (P = 0.04); however, changes were not detected for ELOVL6 protein content. Microarray analysis revealed that genes affecting TG synthesis were downregulated with SCD1 inhibition, which coincided with a 33{\%} decrease in cellular TG content. CONCLUSION: These results provide new mechanistic insight into the role of SCD1 as a regulator of fatty acid profiles and TG synthesis in adipocytes, and reinforce that modulating SCD1 activity may help reduce the risk of obesity-related complications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The nucleic acid-binding protein YB-1, a member of the cold-shock domain protein family, has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer and is associated with poor patient survival. YB-1 has sequence similarity to LIN28, another cold-shock protein family member, which has a role in the regulation of small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) including microRNAs (miRNAs). Therefore, to investigate whether there is an association between YB-1 and sncRNAs in breast cancer, we investigated whether sncRNAs were bound by YB-1 in two breast cancer cell lines (luminal A-like and basal cell-like), and whether the abundance of sncRNAs and mRNAs changed in response to experimental reduction of YB-1 expression. RESULTS RNA-immunoprecipitation with an anti-YB-1 antibody showed that several sncRNAs are bound by YB-1. Some of these were bound by YB-1 in both breast cancer cell lines; others were cell-line specific. The small RNAs bound by YB-1 were derived from various sncRNA families including miRNAs such as let-7 and miR-320, transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA). Reducing YB-1 expression altered the abundance of a number of transcripts encoding miRNA biogenesis and processing proteins but did not alter the abundance of mature or precursor miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS YB-1 binds to specific miRNAs, snoRNAs and tRNA-derived fragments and appears to regulate the expression of miRNA biogenesis and processing machinery. We propose that some of the oncogenic effects of YB-1 in breast cancer may be mediated through its interactions with sncRNAs.},

The reason for this selective targeting of genes with seemingly disparate molecular functions is unclear. In the present work, we show that imprinted genes are coexpressed in a network that is regulated at the transition from proliferation to quiescence and differentiation during fibroblast cell cycle withdrawal, adipogenesis in vitro, and muscle regeneration in vivo. Imprinted gene regulation is not linked to alteration of DNA methylation or to perturbation of monoallelic, parent-of-origin-dependent expression. Overexpression and knockdown of imprinted gene expression alters the sensitivity of preadipocytes to contact inhibition and adipogenic differentiation. In silico and in cellulo experiments showed that the imprinted gene network includes biallelically expressed, nonimprinted genes. These control the extracellular matrix composition, cell adhesion, cell junction, and extracellular matrix-activated and growth factor-activated signaling. These observations show that imprinted genes share a common biological process that may account for their seemingly diverse roles in embryonic development, obesity, diabetes, muscle physiology, and neoplasm.},

Gene coexpression network analysis lends itself to identification of entire groups of differentially regulated genes-a highly relevant endeavor in finding the underpinnings of complex traits that are, by definition, polygenic in nature. Here we describe one such approach based on liver gene expression and genotype data from an F(2) mouse inter-cross utilizing weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of gene expression data to identify physiologically relevant modules. We describe two strategies: single-network analysis and differential network analysis. Single-network analysis reveals the presence of a physiologically interesting module that can be found in two distinct mouse crosses. Module quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) that perturb this module were discovered. In addition, we report a list of genetic drivers for this module. Differential network analysis reveals differences in connectivity and module structure between two networks based on the liver expression data of lean and obese mice. Functional annotation of these genes suggests a biological pathway involving epidermal growth factor (EGF). Our results demonstrate the utility of WGCNA in identifying genetic drivers and in finding genetic pathways represented by gene modules. These examples provide evidence that integration of network properties may well help chart the path across the gene-trait chasm.},

We used primary WAT cells from adult mice and the mouse 3T3-L1 cell-line of preadipocytes for these studies. Cells were labeled with BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene) lipid probe, a marker for fat accumulation in live cells, and sorted on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter into two populations exhibiting low or high BODIPY fluorescence intensity. After more than 12 doublings as dedifferentiated cells in growth medium, the sorted populations were exposed to adipogenic medium for 7 days and analyzed for BODIPY accumulation and mRNA expression of adipogenic markers. WAT-derived cells initially sorted to have low or high BODIPY fluorescence intensity maintained a similar low or high lipid phenotype after redifferentiation. Cell surface TSH receptor expression, which is known to increase when preadipocytes are differentiated, correlated with BODIPY staining in all states. mRNA levels of Ppar$\gamma$, Srebp1c, aP2, and Pref1, key regulators of adipogenesis, and leptin, Glut4, Fasn, and Tshr, markers of adipocyte differentiation, correlated with the levels of fat accumulation. Overexpression of Ppar$\gamma$ in 3T3-L1 cells, as expected, caused cells from low- and high-BODIPY populations to accumulate more fat. More importantly, prior to differentiation, the endogenous Ppar$\gamma$ promoter exhibited higher levels of acetylated histone H3, an activatory modification, in high-BODIPY- compared with low-BODIPY-derived populations. We conclude that fat accumulation is a heritable trait in WAT and that epigenetic modification on the Ppar$\gamma$ promoter contributes to this heritability. {\textcopyright} 2014 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {The differentiation of 3T3 preadipocytes into adipocytes is accompanied by a transient induction of C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta expression in response to treatment of the cells with methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) and dexamethasone (DEX), respectively. In this report, we demonstrate that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes is induced by MIX and DEX, suggesting that C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta may be involved in this process. Using a tetracycline-responsive expression system, we have recently shown that the conditional ectopic expression of C/EBPbeta in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (beta2 cells) in the presence of DEX activates the synthesis of peroxisome PPARgamma mRNA. Subsequent exposure of these cells to PPAR activators stimulates their conversion into adipocytes; however, neither the expression of C/EBPbeta nor exposure to DEX alone is capable of inducing PPARgamma expression in the beta2 cell line. We find that unlike the case for 3T3 preadipocytes, C/EBPdelta is not induced by DEX in these 3T3 fibroblasts and therefore is not relaying the effect of this glucocorticoid to the PPARgamma gene. To define the role of glucocorticoids in regulating PPARgamma expression and the possible involvement of C/EBPdelta, we have established an additional set of NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing either C/EBPdelta alone (delta23 cells) or C/EBPdelta and C/EBPbeta together (beta/delta39 cells), using the tetracycline-responsive system. Culture of these cells in tetracycline-deficient medium containing DEX, MIX, insulin, and fetal bovine serum shows that the beta/delta39 cells express PPARgamma and aP2 mRNAs at levels that are almost equivalent to those observed in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These levels are approximately threefold higher than their levels of expression in the beta2 cells. Despite the fact that these beta/delta39 cells produce abundant amounts of C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta (in the absence of tetracycline), they still require glucocorticoids to attain maximum expression of PPARgamma mRNA. Furthermore, the induction of PPARgamma mRNA by exposure of these cells to DEX occurs in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis. The delta23 cells, on the other hand, are not capable of activating PPARgamma gene expression when exposed to the same adipogenic inducers. Finally, attenuation of ectopic C/EBPbeta production at various stages during the differentiation process results in a concomitant inhibition of PPARgamma and the adipogenic program. These data strongly suggest that the induction of PPARgamma gene expression in multipotential mesenchymal stem cells (NIH 3T3 fibroblasts) is dependent on elevated levels of C/EBPbeta throughout the differentiation process, as well as an initial exposure to glucocorticoids. C/EBPdelta may function by synergizing with C/EBPbeta to enhance the level of PPARgamma expression.},

abstract = {Nuclear receptors comprise a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that play important roles in both physiology and diseases including cancer. The technologies of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by array hybridization (ChIP-chip) or massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been used to map, at an unprecedented rate, the in vivo genome-wide binding (cistrome) of nuclear receptors in both normal and cancer cells. We developed a curated database of 88 nuclear receptor cistrome data sets and other associated high-throughput data sets including 121 collaborating factor cistromes, 94 epigenomes, and 319 transcriptomes. Through integrative analysis of the curated nuclear receptor ChIP-chip/seq data sets, we discovered novel factor-specific noncanonical motifs that may have important regulatory roles. We also revealed a common feature of nuclear receptor pioneering factors to recognize relatively short and AT-rich motifs. Most nuclear receptors bind predominantly to introns and distal intergenetic regions, and binding sites closer to transcription start sites were found to be neither stronger nor more evolutionarily conserved. Interestingly, while most nuclear receptors appear to be predominantly transcriptional activators, our analysis suggests that the binding of ESR1, RARA, and RARG has both activating and repressive effects. Through meta-analysis of different omic data of the same cancer cell line model from multiple studies, we generated consensus cistrome and expression profiles. We further made probabilistic predictions of the nuclear receptor target genes by integrating cistrome and transcriptome data and validated the predictions using expression data from tumor samples. The final database, with comprehensive cistrome, epigenome, and transcriptome data sets and downstream analysis results, constitutes a valuable resource for the nuclear receptor and cancer community.},

abstract = {The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is the target of antidiabetic thiazolidinedione drugs, which improve insulin resistance but have side effects that limit widespread use. PPARgamma is required for adipocyte differentiation, but it is also expressed in other cell types, notably macrophages, where it influences atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. A central question is whether PPARgamma binding in macrophages occurs at genomic locations the same as or different from those in adipocytes. Here, utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we demonstrate that PPARgamma cistromes in mouse adipocytes and macrophages are predominantly cell type specific. In thioglycolate-elicited macrophages, PPARgamma colocalizes with the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 in areas of open chromatin and histone acetylation, near a distinct set of immune genes in addition to a number of metabolic genes shared with adipocytes. In adipocytes, the macrophage-unique binding regions are marked with repressive histone modifications, typically associated with local chromatin compaction and gene silencing. PPARgamma, when introduced into preadipocytes, bound only to regions depleted of repressive histone modifications, where it increased DNA accessibility, enhanced histone acetylation, and induced gene expression. Thus, the cell specificity of PPARgamma function is regulated by cell-specific transcription factors, chromatin accessibility, and histone marks. Our data support the existence of an epigenomic hierarchy in which PPARgamma binding to cell-specific sites not marked by repressive marks opens chromatin and leads to local activation marks, including histone acetylation.},

abstract = { Mediator is a general coactivator complex connecting transcription activators and RNA polymerase II. Recent work has shown that the nuclear receptor-interacting MED1/TRAP220 subunit of Mediator is required for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$)-stimulated adipogenesis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). However, the molecular mechanisms remain undefined. Here, we show an intracellular PPAR$\gamma$-Mediator interaction that requires the two LXXLL nuclear receptor recognition motifs on MED1/TRAP220 and, furthermore, we show that the intact LXXLL motifs are essential for optimal PPAR$\gamma$ function in a reconstituted cell-free transcription system. Surprisingly, a conserved N-terminal region of MED1/TRAP220 that lacks the LXXLL motifs but gets incorporated into Mediator fully supports PPAR$\gamma$-stimulated adipogenesis. Moreover, in undifferentiated MEFs, MED1/TRAP220 is dispensable both for PPAR$\gamma$-mediated target gene activation and for recruitment of Mediator to a PPAR response element on the aP2 target gene promoter. However, PPAR$\gamma$ shows significantly reduced transcriptional activity in cells deficient for a subunit (MED24/TRAP100) important for the integrity of the Mediator complex, indicating a general Mediator requirement for PPAR$\gamma$ function. These results indicate that there is a conditional requirement for MED1/TRAP220 and that a direct interaction between PPAR$\gamma$ and Mediator through MED1/TRAP220 is not essential either for PPAR$\gamma$-stimulated adipogenesis or for PPAR$\gamma$ target gene expression in cultured fibroblasts. As Mediator is apparently essential for PPAR$\gamma$ transcriptional activity, our data indicate the presence of alternative mechanisms for Mediator recruitment, possibly through intermediate cofactors or other cofactors that are functionally redundant with MED1/TRAP220. },

abstract = {Inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein is widespread in human cancers. Inactivation of Rb is thought to be initiated by association with Raf-1 (C-Raf) kinase, and here we determined how RRD-251, a disruptor of the Rb-Raf-1 interaction, affects pancreatic tumor progression. Assessment of phospho-Rb levels in resected human pancreatic tumor specimens by immunohistochemistry (n = 95) showed that increased Rb phosphorylation correlated with increasing grade of resected human pancreatic adenocarcinomas (P = 0.0272), which correlated with reduced overall patient survival (P = 0.0186). To define the antitumor effects of RRD-251 (50 $\mu$mol/L), cell-cycle analyses, senescence, cell viability, cell migration, anchorage-independent growth, angiogenic tubule formation and invasion assays were conducted on gemcitabine-sensitive and -resistant pancreatic cancer cells. RRD-251 prevented S-phase entry, induced senescence and apoptosis, and inhibited anchorage-independent growth and invasion (P {\textless} 0.01). Drug efficacy on subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models was tested by intraperitoneal injections of RRD-251 (50 mg/kg) alone or in combination with gemcitabine (250 mg/kg). RRD-251 significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo accompanied by reduced Rb phosphorylation and lymph node and liver metastasis (P {\textless} 0.01). Combination of RRD-251 with gemcitabine showed cooperative effect on tumor growth (P {\textless} 0.01). In conclusion, disruption of the Rb-Raf-1 interaction significantly reduces the malignant properties of pancreatic cancer cells irrespective of their gemcitabine sensitivity. Selective targeting of Rb-Raf-1 interaction might be a promising strategy targeting pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {Understanding recent biogeographic responses to climate change is fundamental for improving our predictions of likely future responses and guiding conservation planning at both local and global scales. Studies of observed biogeographic responses to 20th century climate change have principally examined effects related to ubiquitous increases in temperature - collectively termed a warming fingerprint. Although the importance of changes in other aspects of climate - particularly precipitation and water availability - is widely acknowledged from a theoretical standpoint and supported by paleontological evidence, we lack a practical understanding of how these changes interact with temperature to drive biogeographic responses. Further complicating matters, differences in life history and ecological attributes may lead species to respond differently to the same changes in climate. Here, we examine whether recent biogeographic patterns across California are consistent with a warming fingerprint. We describe how various components of climate have changed regionally in California during the 20th century and review empirical evidence of biogeographic responses to these changes, particularly elevational range shifts. Many responses to climate change do not appear to be consistent with a warming fingerprint, with downslope shifts in elevation being as common as upslope shifts across a number of taxa and many demographic and community responses being inconsistent with upslope shifts. We identify a number of potential direct and indirect mechanisms for these responses, including the influence of aspects of climate change other than temperature (e. g., the shifting seasonal balance of energy and water availability), differences in each taxon's sensitivity to climate change, trophic interactions, and land-use change. Finally, we highlight the need to move beyond a warming fingerprint in studies of biogeographic responses by considering a more multifaceted view of climate, emphasizing local-scale effects, and including a priori knowledge of relevant natural history for the taxa and regions under study.},

abstract = {Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity is required for growth factor-induced cytoskeletal regulation and cell migration. We previously found that in MTLn3 rat adenocarcinoma cells, EGF-stimulated induction of actin barbed ends and lamellipod extension specifically requires the p85/p110? isoform of PI 3-kinase. To further characterize signaling by distinct PI 3-kinase isoforms, we have developed MTLn3 cells that transiently or stably overexpress either p110? or p110?. Transient overexpression of p110? inhibited EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension, whereas p110?-transfected cells showed normal EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension. Similar results were obtained by overexpression of kinase-dead p110?, suggesting that effects on cytoskeletal signaling were due to competition with p85/p110? complexes. Stable overexpression of p110? appeared to be toxic, based on the difficulty in obtaining stable overexpressing clones. In contrast, cells expressing a 2-fold increase in p110? were readily obtainable. Interestingly, cells stably expressing p110 ? showed a marked inhibition of EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension. Using computer-assisted analysis of time-lapse images, we found that overexpression of p110? caused a nearly complete inhibition of motility. Cells overexpressing p110 ? showed normal activation of Akt and Erk, suggesting that overall PI 3-kinase signaling was intact. A chimeric p110 molecule containing the p85-binding and Ras-binding domains of p110? and the C2, helical, and kinase domains of p110?, was catalytically active yet also inhibited EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension. These data highlight the differential signaling by distinct p110 isoforms. Identification of effectors that are differently regulated by p110? versus p110? will be important for understanding cell migration and its role in metastasis. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {MAP1LC3/LC3 (a mammalian ortholog family of yeast Atg8) is a ubiquitin-like protein that is essential for autophagosome formation. LC3 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine on phagophores and ends up distributed both inside and outside the autophagosome membrane. One of the well-known functions of LC3 is as a binding partner for receptor proteins, which target polyubiquitinated organelles and proteins to the phagophore through direct interaction with LC3 in selective autophagy, and their LC3-binding ability is essential for degradation of the polyubiquitinated substances. Although a number of LC3-binding proteins have been identified, it is unknown whether they are substrates of autophagy or how their interaction with LC3 is regulated. We previously showed that one LC3-binding protein, TBC1D25/OATL1, plays an inhibitory role in the maturation step of autophagosomes and that this function depends on its binding to LC3. Interestingly, TBC1D25 seems not to be a substrate of autophagy, despite being present on the phagophore. In this study we investigated the molecular basis for the escape of TBC1D25 from autophagic degradation by performing a chimeric analysis between TBC1D25 and SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1), and the results showed that mutant TBC1D25 with an intact LC3-binding site can become an autophagic substrate when TBC1D25 is forcibly oligomerized. In addition, an ultrastructural analysis showed that TBC1D25 is mainly localized outside autophagosomes, whereas an oligomerized TBC1D25 mutant rather uniformly resides both inside and outside the autophagosomes. Our findings indicate that oligomerization is a key factor in the degradation of LC3-binding proteins and suggest that lack of oligomerization ability of TBC1D25 results in its asymmetric localization at the outer autophagosome membrane.},

abstract = {Bladder cancer is one of the leading cancer of the urinary tract. It is often diagnosed at advanced stage of the disease. To date, no specific and effective early detection biomarkers are available. Cancer development and progression are associated with the involvement of both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor microenvironment of which NGAL/MMP-9 complex represents the main player in bladder cancer. It is known that change in microRNAs (miRNAs) expression may result in gene modulation. Therefore, the identification of specific miRNAs associated with EMT pathway and NGAL/MMP-9 complex may be useful to detect the development of bladder cancer at early stages.On this ground, the expression levels of miRNAs in public available datasets of bladder cancer containing data of non-coding RNA profiling was evaluated. This analysis revealed a group of 16 miRNAs differentially expressed between bladder cancer patients and related healthy controls. By miRNA prediction tool (mirDIP), the relationship between the identified miRNAs and the EMT genes was established. Using the DIANA-mirPath (v.2) software, miRNAs, able to modulate the expression of NGAL and MMP-9 genes, were recognized.The results of this study provide evidence that the downregulated hsa-miR-145-5p and hsa-miR-214-3p may modulate the expression of both EMT and NGAL/MMP-9 pathways. Therefore, further validation analyses may confirm the usefulness of these selected miRNAs for predicting the development of bladder cancer at the early stage of the disease.},

abstract = {Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) play important roles in health and disease. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are considered as the most powerful and versatile methodologies to explore small RNA (sRNA) transcriptomes in diverse experimental and clinical studies. Small RNA-Seq (sRNA-Seq) data analysis proved to be challenging due to non-unique genomic origin, short length, and abundant post-transcriptional modifications of sRNA species. Here, we present Manatee, an algorithm for the quantification of sRNA classes and the detection of novel expressed non-coding loci. Manatee combines prior annotation of sRNAs with reliable alignment density information and extensive rescue of usually neglected multimapped reads to provide accurate transcriptome-wide sRNA expression quantification. Comparison of Manatee against state-of-the-art implementations using real and simulated data demonstrates its high accuracy across diverse sRNA classes. Manatee also goes beyond common pipelines by identifying and quantifying expression from unannotated loci and microRNA isoforms (isomiRs). It is user-friendly, can be easily incorporated in pipelines, and provides a simplified output suitable for direct usage in downstream analyses and functional studies.},

abstract = {Tumour metastasis suppressors are inhibitors of metastasis but their mechanisms of action are generally not understood. We previously showed that the suppressor Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) inhibits breast tumour metastasis in part via let-7. Here, we demonstrate an integrated approach combining statistical analysis of breast tumour gene expression data and experimental validation to extend the signalling pathway for RKIP. We show that RKIP inhibits let-7 targets (HMGA2, BACH1) that in turn upregulate bone metastasis genes (MMP1, OPN, CXCR4). Our results reveal BACH1 as a novel let-7-regulated transcription factor that induces matrix metalloproteinase1 (MMP1) expression and promotes metastasis. An RKIP pathway metastasis signature (designated RPMS) derived from the complete signalling cascade predicts high metastatic risk better than the individual genes. These results highlight a powerful approach for identifying signalling pathways downstream of a key metastasis suppressor and indicate that analysis of genes in the context of their signalling environment is critical for understanding their predictive and therapeutic potential.},

Both the conserved chromo- and SET domains of Clr4 are required for H3 Lys9 methylation in vivo. Localization of Swi6, a homolog of Drosophila HP1, to heterochomatic regions is dependent on H3 Lys9 methylation. Moreover, an H3-specific deacetylase Clr3 and a beta-propeller domain protein Rik1 are required for H3 Lys9 methylation by Clr4 and Swi6 localization. These data define a conserved pathway wherein sequential histone modifications establish a "histone code" essential for the epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin assembly.},

Beyond this, the availability of extracellular and intracellular metabolites may serve as metabolic signals interconnecting with cellular signaling events to influence cellular fate and immunological function. As such, tumor microenvironment represents a dramatic example of metabolic derangement, where the highly metabolic demanding tumor cells may compromise the function of some immune cells by competing nutrients (a form of intercellular competition), meanwhile may support the function of other immune cells by forming a metabolic symbiosis (a form of intercellular collaboration). It has been well known that tumor cells harness immune system through information exchanges that are largely attributed to soluble protein factors and intercellular junctions. In this review, we will discuss recent advance on tumor metabolism and immune metabolism, as well as provide examples of metabolic communications between tumor cells and immune system, which may represent a novel mechanism of conveying tumor-immune privilege.},

abstract = {Oxidized phospholipids are thought to promote atherogenesis by stimulating endothelial cells (ECs) to produce inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8. In studies with mouse models, we previously demonstrated that genetic variation in inflammatory responses of endothelial cells to oxidized lipids contributes importantly to atherosclerosis susceptibility. We now show that similar variations occur in cultured aortic ECs derived from multiple heart transplant donors. These variations were stably maintained between passages and, thus, reflect either genetic or epigenetic regulatory differences. Expression array analysis of aortic EC cultures derived from 12 individuals revealed that {\textgreater}1,000 genes were regulated by oxidized phospholipids. We have used the observed variations in the sampled population to construct a gene coexpression network comprised of 15 modules of highly connected genes. We show that several identified modules are significantly enriched in genes for known pathways and confirm a module enriched for unfolded protein response (UPR) genes using siRNA and the UPR inducer tunicamycin. On the basis of the constructed network, we predicted that a gene of unknown function (MGC4504) present in the UPR module is a target for UPR transcriptional activator ATF4. Our data also indicate that IL-8 is present in the UPR module and is regulated, in part, by the UPR. We validate these by using siRNA. In conclusion, we show that interindividual variability can be used to group genes into pathways and predict gene-gene regulatory relationships, thus identifying targets potentially involved in susceptibility to common diseases such as atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most thoroughly studied eukaryote at the cellular, molecular, and genetic level. Recent boost in whole-genome sequencing, array-based allelic variation mapping, and genome-wide transcriptional profiling have unprecedentedly advanced knowledge on cell biology and evolution of this organism. It is now possible to investigate how evolution shapes the functional architecture of yeast genomes and how this architecture relates to the evolution of the regulatory networks controlling the expression of genes that make up an organism. A survey of the information on genetic and whole-genome expression variations in yeast populations shows that a significant score of gene expression variation is dependent on genotype-by-environment interaction. In some cases, large trans effects are the result of mutations in the promoters of key master regulator genes. Yet trans-variation in environmental sensor proteins appears to explain the majority of the expression patterns differentiating strains in natural populations. The challenge is now to use this information to model how individual genetic polymorphisms interact in a condition-dependent fashion to produce phenotypic change. In this study, we show how fruitful application of systems biology to the progress of science and medicine requires the use of evolution as a lens to reconstruct the hierarchical structure of regulation of biological systems. The lessons learned in yeast can be of paramount importance in advancing the application of genomics and systems biology to emerging fields including personalized medicine.},

Recently, several large-scale studies have shed light on this problem through analysis of gene expression profiles to identify markers correlated with metastasis. Here, we apply a protein-network-based approach that identifies markers not as individual genes but as subnetworks extracted from protein interaction databases. The resulting subnetworks provide novel hypotheses for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis of differential expression, they play a central role in the protein network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual marker genes selected without network information, and that they achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus non-metastatic tumors.},

In this approach the vectors stably integrate in the host cell genome and induce cancers by dysregulating nearby genes. The cells that contain a retroviral vector provirus in or near a proto-oncogene or tumor suppressor are preferentially enriched in a tumor. {\&}gamma;RV and LV vectors have different integration profiles and genotoxic potential, making them potentially complementary tools for insertional mutagenesis screens. We performed screens using both {\&}gamma;RV and LV vectors to identify driver genes that mediate progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) using a xenotransplant mouse model. Vector transduced LNCaP cells were injected orthotopically into the prostate gland of immunodeficient mice. Mice that developed tumors were castrated to create an androgen-deficient environment and metastatic tumors that developed were analyzed. A high-throughput modified genomic sequencing PCR (MGS-PCR) approach identified the positions of vector integrations in these metastatic tumors.

TAOK3  and  ABCC1  expression in PC patients predicted the risk of recurrence after androgen deprivation therapy. Our data shows that {\&}gamma;RV and LV vectors are complementary approaches to identify cancer driver genes which may be promising potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

The catabolites produced are redistributed to various cellular compartments to support basic cellular function. Several studies demonstrated a bidirectional relationship between lipids and lysosomes that regulate autophagy. While lysosomal degradation pathways regulate cellular lipid metabolism, lipids also regulate lysosome function and autophagy.

The accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins may disrupt cellular functions by affecting protein expression, protein turnover, cell signaling, and induction of apoptosis and necrosis, suggesting that protein oxidation could have both physiological and pathological significance. For nearly two decades, our laboratory focused particular attention on studying oxidative damage of proteins and how their chemical modifications induced by reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species correlate with pathology, biochemical alterations, and clinical presentations of Alzheimer's disease. This comprehensive article outlines basic knowledge of oxidative modification of proteins and lipids, followed by the principles of redox proteomics analysis, which also involve recent advances of mass spectrometry technology, and its application to selected age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Redox proteomics results obtained in different diseases and animal models thereof may provide new insights into the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of oxidative-stress-related neurodegenerative disorders. Redox proteomics can be considered a multifaceted approach that has the potential to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of a disease, to find disease markers, as well as to identify potential targets for drug therapy. Considering the importance of a better understanding of the cause/effect of protein dysfunction in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders, this article provides an overview of the intrinsic power of the redox proteomics approach together with the most significant results obtained by our laboratory and others during almost 10 years of research on neurodegenerative disorders since we initiated the field of redox proteomics.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a molecular process through which an epithelial cell undergoes transdifferentiation into a mesenchymal phenotype. The role of EMT in embryogenesis is well-characterized and increasing evidence suggests that elements of the transition may be important in other processes, including metastasis and drug resistance in various different cancers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Agilent 4 × 44 K whole human genome arrays and selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry were used to investigate mRNA and protein expression in A2780 cisplatin sensitive and resistant cell lines. Invasion and migration were assessed using Boyden chamber assays. Gene knockdown of snail and slug was done using targeted siRNA. Clinical relevance of the EMT pathway was assessed in a cohort of primary ovarian tumours using data from Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Morphological and phenotypic hallmarks of EMT were identified in the chemoresistant cells. Subsequent gene expression profiling revealed upregulation of EMT-related transcription factors including snail, slug, twist2 and zeb2. Proteomic analysis demonstrated up regulation of Snail and Slug as well as the mesenchymal marker Vimentin, and down regulation of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker. By reducing expression of snail and slug, the mesenchymal phenotype was largely reversed and cells were resensitized to cisplatin. Finally, gene expression data from primary tumours mirrored the finding that an EMT-like pathway is activated in resistant tumours relative to sensitive tumours, suggesting that the involvement of this transition may not be limited to in vitro drug effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This work strongly suggests that genes associated with EMT may play a significant role in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, therefore potentially leading to the development of predictive biomarkers of drug response or novel therapeutic strategies for overcoming drug resistance.},

Recently, WDR45 mutations were reported in patients with $\beta$-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), characterized by early intellectual disability followed by delayed progressive motor and cognitive deterioration with onset in the second to third decade. BPAN has a distinct brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern showing iron deposition in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. To date, many of the BPAN patients have been diagnosed in adulthood. Here, we report on 6-year-old girl with BPAN diagnosed by whole exome sequencing. She showed Rett syndrome-like manifestations, a peculiar facial appearance and mildly elevated serum enzymes. Brain iron accumulation was detected by T2*-weighted MRI and T2-star weighted angiography (SWAN). This unique combination of clinical and neuroimaging features may be helpful for early diagnosis of BPAN. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved. Autophagy, activated by many stresses, plays a critical role in innate immune responses. Here we show that interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is required for the expression of autophagy-related genes in dendritic cells. Furthermore in macrophages, IRF8 is induced by multiple autophagy-inducing stresses, including IFN$\gamma$ and Toll-like receptor stimulation, bacterial infection, starvation and by macrophage colony-stimulating factor. IRF8 directly activates many genes involved in various steps of autophagy, promoting autophagosome formation and lysosomal fusion. Consequently, Irf8 -/- macrophages are deficient in autophagic activity, and excessively accumulate SQSTM1 and ubiquitin-bound proteins. We show that clearance of Listeria monocytogenes in macrophages requires IRF8-dependent activation of autophagy genes and subsequent autophagic capturing and degradation of Listeria antigens. These processes are defective in Irf8 -/- macrophages where uninhibited bacterial growth ensues. Together these data suggest that IRF8 is a major autophagy regulator in macrophages, essential for macrophage maturation, survival and innate immune responses.},

Therefore, heat-clearing and detoxicating (HCD) herbs are essential components of TCM formulas for cancer treatment. An increasing interest has been focused on the study of HCD herbs and accumulated evidences have shown that HCD herbs or HCD herbs-based formulas exhibited remarkable anticancer effects when used alone or combined with other therapeutic approaches. Some of the HCD herb-derived products have been tested in clinical trials. Studies revealed that extracts or pure compounds of the HCD herbs showed a broad anticancer spectrum against both solid and hematologic malignancies without significant toxic effects. Notably, some HCD herbs or formulas could strongly enhance the anticancer activities of chemo- or radio-therapy and alleviate their side effects. The anticancer activities of HCD herb exacts or the pure compounds were reported to be through multiple cellular or molecular mechanisms, such as induction of cancer cell apoptosis, differentiation and cell cycle arrest, inhibition of cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis, and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. In this review, we provide comprehensive analysis and summary of research progress and future prospects in this field to facilitate the further study and application of HCD herbs.},

In this study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing to generate genome-wide maps of PPARgamma and retinoid X receptor (RXR)-binding sites, and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy at very high resolution throughout adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. We identify {\textgreater}5000 high-confidence shared PPARgamma:RXR-binding sites in adipocytes and show that during early stages of differentiation, many of these are preoccupied by non-PPARgamma RXR-heterodimers. Different temporal and compositional patterns of occupancy are observed. In addition, we detect co-occupancy with members of the C/EBP family. Analysis of RNAPII occupancy uncovers distinct clusters of similarly regulated genes of different biological processes. PPARgamma:RXR binding is associated with the majority of induced genes, and sites are particularly abundant in the vicinity of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Our analyses represent the first genome-wide map of PPARgamma:RXR target sites and changes in RNAPII occupancy throughout adipocyte differentiation and indicate that a hitherto unrecognized high number of adipocyte genes of distinctly regulated pathways are directly activated by PPARgamma:RXR.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids play important roles in the regulation of distinct aspects of adipocyte biology. Excess glucocorticoids in adipocytes are associated with metabolic disorders, including central obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. To understand the mechanisms underlying the glucocorticoid action in adipocytes, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to isolate genome-wide glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding regions (GBRs) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, gene expression analyses were used to identify genes that were regulated by glucocorticoids. Overall, 274 glucocorticoid-regulated genes contain or locate nearby GBR. We found that many GBRs were located in or nearby genes involved in triglyceride (TG) synthesis (Scd-1, 2, 3, GPAT3, GPAT4, Agpat2, Lpin1), lipolysis (Lipe, Mgll), lipid transport (Cd36, Lrp-1, Vldlr, Slc27a2) and storage (S3-12). Gene expression analysis showed that except for Scd-3, the other 13 genes were induced in mouse inguinal fat upon 4-day glucocorticoid treatment. Reporter gene assays showed that except Agpat2, the other 12 glucocorticoid-regulated genes contain at least one GBR that can mediate hormone response. In agreement with the fact that glucocorticoids activated genes in both TG biosynthetic and lipolytic pathways, we confirmed that 4-day glucocorticoid treatment increased TG synthesis and lipolysis concomitantly in inguinal fat. Notably, we found that 9 of these 12 genes were induced in transgenic mice that have constant elevated plasma glucocorticoid levels. These results suggested that a similar mechanism was used to regulate TG homeostasis during chronic glucocorticoid treatment. In summary, our studies have identified molecular components in a glucocorticoid-controlled gene network involved in the regulation of TG homeostasis in adipocytes. Understanding the regulation of this gene network should provide important insight for future therapeutic developments for metabolic diseases.},

abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex change in cell differentiation that allows breast carcinoma cells to acquire invasive properties. EMT involves a cascade of regulatory changes that destabilize the epithelial phenotype and allow mesenchymal features to manifest. As transcription factors (TFs) are upstream effectors of the genome-wide expression changes that result in phenotypic change, understanding the sequential changes in TF activity during EMT provides rich information on the mechanism of this process. Because molecular interactions will vary as cells progress from an epithelial to a mesenchymal differentiation program, dynamic networks are needed to capture the changing context of molecular processes. In this study we applied an emerging high-throughput, dynamic TF activity array to define TF activity network changes in three cell-based models of EMT in breast cancer based on HMLE Twist ER and MCF-7 mammary epithelial cells. The TF array distinguished conserved from model-specific TF activity changes in the three models. Time-dependent data was used to identify pairs of TF activities with significant positive or negative correlation, indicative of interdependent TF activity throughout the six-day study period. Dynamic TF activity patterns were clustered into groups of TFs that change along a time course of gene expression changes and acquisition of invasive capacity. Time-dependent TF activity data was combined with prior knowledge of TF interactions to construct dynamic models of TF activity networks as epithelial cells acquire invasive characteristics. These analyses show EMT from a unique and targetable vantage and may ultimately contribute to diagnosis and therapy.},

To investigate the influence of miRNAs on transcript levels, we transfected miRNAs into human cells and used microarrays to examine changes in the messenger RNA profile. Here we show that delivering miR-124 causes the expression profile to shift towards that of brain, the organ in which miR-124 is preferentially expressed, whereas delivering miR-1 shifts the profile towards that of muscle, where miR-1 is preferentially expressed. In each case, about 100 messages were downregulated after 12 h. The 3' untranslated regions of these messages had a significant propensity to pair to the 5' region of the miRNA, as expected if many of these messages are the direct targets of the miRNAs. Our results suggest that metazoan miRNAs can reduce the levels of many of their target transcripts, not just the amount of protein deriving from these transcripts. Moreover, miR-1 and miR-124, and presumably other tissue-specific miRNAs, seem to downregulate a far greater number of targets than previously appreciated, thereby helping to define tissue-specific gene expression in humans.},

In contrast, calorie restriction and weight reduction can drastically prevent type 2 diabetes, indicating a central role of nutrient excess in the development of diabetes. Recently, the molecular links between excessive nutrients, organelle stress, and development of metabolic disease have been extensively studied. Specifically, excessive nutrients trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress and increase the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, leading to activation of stress signaling pathway, inflammatory response, lipogenesis, and pancreatic beta-cell death. Autophagy is required for clearance of hepatic lipid clearance, alleviation of pancreatic beta-cell stress, and white adipocyte differentiation. ROS scavengers, chemical chaperones, and autophagy activators have demonstrated promising effects for the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes in preclinical models.

The mechanisms linking lysosomal defects and epithelial dysfunction remain unknown, preventing the development of disease-modifying therapies. Here we demonstrate, by combining genetic and pharmacologic approaches, that lysosomal dysfunction in cystinosis results in defective autophagy-mediated clearance of damaged mitochondria. This promotes the generation of oxidative stress that stimulates G$\alpha$12/Src-mediated phosphorylation of tight junction ZO-1 and triggers a signaling cascade involving ZO-1-associated Y-box factor ZONAB, which leads to cell proliferation and transport defects. Correction of the primary lysosomal defect, neutralization of mitochondrial oxidative stress, and blockage of tight junction-associated ZONAB signaling rescue the epithelial function. We suggest a link between defective lysosome-autophagy degradation pathways and epithelial dysfunction, providing new therapeutic perspectives for lysosomal storage disorders.},

We found that JARID1D specifically repressed the invasion-associated genes MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, and Slug by demethylating trimethyl H3K4, a gene-activating mark, at their promoters. Our additional results demonstrated that JARID1D levels were highly downregulated in metastatic prostate tumors compared with normal prostate tissues and primary prostate tumors. Furthermore, the JARID1D gene was frequently deleted in metastatic prostate tumors, and low JARID1D levels were associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that an epigenetic modifier expressed on the Y chromosome functions as an anti-invasion factor to suppress the progression of prostate cancer. Our results also highlight a preclinical rationale for using JARID1D as a prognostic marker in advanced prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that potential interactions within metabolic, protein-protein interaction, and transcriptional regulatory networks are used differentially according to the environmental conditions in which a cell exists. However, the topological units underlying such differential utilization are not understood. Here we use the transcriptional regulatory network of Escherichia coli to identify such units, called origons, representing regulatory subnetworks that originate at a distinct class of sensor transcription factors. Using microarray data, we find that specific environmental signals affect mRNA expression levels significantly only within the origons responsible for their detection and processing. We also show that small regulatory interaction patterns, called subgraphs and motifs, occupy distinct positions in and between origons, offering insights into their dynamical role in information processing. The identified features are likely to represent a general framework for environmental signal processing in prokaryotes.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The clinical outcome to Leishmania-infection is determined by the individual adaptive immune T helper cell responses and their interactions with parasitized host cells. An early development of a proinflammatory immune response (Th1 response) is necessary for Leishmania-infection resolution. The Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) regulates human Toll-like receptors signaling pathways by down regulating the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and inducing the ant-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Polymorphisms in the TOLLIP gene are associated with infectious diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The polymorphisms rs5743899 and rs3750920 in the TOLLIP gene were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in 631 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by L. guyanensis and 530 individuals with no history of leishmaniasis. RESULTS: The G and T alleles of the rs5743899 and rs3750920 were more common in patients with CL than in healthy individuals (P = 2.6 x10(-8) ; odds ratio [OR], 1.7 [ 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.4-2.0] and P = 1.9 x10(-8) ; OR, 1.6 [95{\%} CI 1.4-1.9] respectively). The r2 and D' linkage disequilibrium between the two polymorphisms are 0.05 and 0.473 with a confidence bounds of 0.37 to 0.57 respectively. CONCLUSION: The two polymorphisms are independently associated with an increased risk of developing CL.},

abstract = {The developments in the molecular biosciences have made possible a shift to combined molecular and system-level approaches to biological research under the name of Systems Biology. It integrates many types of molecular knowledge, which can best be achieved by the synergistic use of models and experimental data. Many different types of modeling approaches are useful depending on the amount and quality of the molecular data available and the purpose of the model. Analysis of such models and the structure of molecular networks have led to the discovery of principles of cell functioning overarching single species. Two main approaches of systems biology can be distinguished. Top-down systems biology is a method to characterize cells using system-wide data originating from the Omics in combination with modeling. Those models are often phenomenological but serve to discover new insights into the molecular network under study. Bottom-up systems biology does not start with data but with a detailed model of a molecular network on the basis of its molecular properties. In this approach, molecular networks can be quantitatively studied leading to predictive models that can be applied in drug design and optimization of product formation in bioengineering. In this chapter we introduce analysis of molecular network by use of models, the two approaches to systems biology, and we shall discuss a number of examples of recent successes in systems biology.},

This is because interactions among the genes and their products play an important role in many molecular processes. A gene regulatory network can act as a blueprint for the researchers to observe the relationships among genes. Due to its importance, several computational approaches have been proposed to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. In this review, six inference approaches are discussed: Boolean network, probabilistic Boolean network, ordinary differential equation, neural network, Bayesian network, and dynamic Bayesian network. These approaches are discussed in terms of introduction, methodology and recent applications of these approaches in gene regulatory network construction. These approaches are also compared in the discussion section. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of these computational approaches are described. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {$\beta$-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) initiates APP cleavage, which has been reported to be an inducer of tau pathology by altering proteasome functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact relationship between BACE1 and PHF (Paired Helical Filaments) formation is not clear. In this study, we confirm that BACE1 and Hsc70 are upregulated in the brains of AD patients, and we demonstrate that both proteins show enhanced expression in lipid rafts from AD-affected triple transgenic mouse brains. BACE1 targeting increased Hsc70 levels in the membrane and cytoplasm fractions and downregulated Hsp90 and CHIP in the nucleus in the hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice. However, these observations occurred in a proteasome-independent manner in vitro. The BACE1miR-induced reduction of soluble hyperphosphorylated tau was associated with a decrease in MAPK activity. However, the BACE1 RNAi-mediated reduction of hyperphosphorylated tau was only blocked by 3-MA (3-methyladenine) in vitro, and it resulted in the increase of Hsc70 and LAMP2 in lipid rafts from hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, and upregulation of survival and homeostasis signaling. In summary, our findings suggest that BACE1 silencing neuroprotects reducing soluble hyperphosphorylated tau, modulating certain autophagy-related proteins in aged 3xTg-AD mice.},

In the search for new molecules that could be used for the treatment of obesity, good perspectives have been opened up for polyphenols, a class of natural bioactive phytochemicals. Experimental and limited clinical trial evidence supports that some polyphenols such as quercetin, curcumin, and resveratrol have potential benefit functions on obesity treatment. This brief review focuses on the main functions of the above-named polyphenols on adipose tissue. These polyphenols may play beneficial effects on adipose tissue under obese condition by alleviating intracellular oxidative stress, reducing chronic low-grade inflammation, inhibiting adipogenesis and lipogenesis, and suppressing the differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although far from complete, such maps have revealed global topological and dynamic features of interactome networks that relate to known biological properties, suggesting that a human interactome map will provide insight into development and disease mechanisms at a systems level. Here we describe an initial version of a proteome-scale map of human binary protein-protein interactions. Using a stringent, high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system, we tested pairwise interactions among the products of approximately 8,100 currently available Gateway-cloned open reading frames and detected approximately 2,800 interactions. This data set, called CCSB-HI1, has a verification rate of approximately 78{\%} as revealed by an independent co-affinity purification assay, and correlates significantly with other biological attributes. The CCSB-HI1 data set increases by approximately 70{\%} the set of available binary interactions within the tested space and reveals more than 300 new connections to over 100 disease-associated proteins.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aberrant expression of miR-378 has been observed in various malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the mechanism regulating of miR-378 expression remains unknown. This study was aimed to investigate miR-378 methylation and to explore its clinical significance in AML. METHODS: Methylation status of miR-378 5'-flanking region was investigated by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RQ-MSP) and bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP). The expression of miR-378 was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). The correlation between expression of miR-378 and 5'-flanking region methylation was analyzed using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) treatment. RESULTS: miR-378 5'-flanking region was significantly hypomethylated in AML patients compared to controls (median 0.109 vs. 0.058) (P=0.048). miR-378 expression was correlated with miR-378 5'-flanking region in leukemic cell line treated with 5-aza-dC, but not in AML patients. The level of miR-378 hypomethylation significantly increased in M2 subtype compared to other subtypes. Moreover, patients with t(8;21) harbored the highest level of miR-378 hypomethylation. However, there was no significant difference in overall survival between patients with high and low miR-378 hypomethylation. The association of miR-378 expression with methylation was not observed in AML patients, but miR-378 expression in THP-1 line was increased while methylation status of miR-378 5-flanking region was decreased after 5-aza-dC treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that miR-378 is reactivated by demethylation after 5-aza-dC treatment. 5'-flanking region of miR-378 is hypomethylated in AML especially in those with t(8;21).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes originate from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and there appears to be a reciprocal relationship between adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. Alterations in the balance between adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis in BMMSCs wherein adipogenesis is increased relative to osteoblastogenesis are associated with decreased bone quality and quantity. Several proteins have been reported to regulate this reciprocal relationship but the exact nature of the signals regulating the balance between osteoblast and adipocyte formation within the bone marrow space remains to be determined. In this review, we focus on the role of Transducin-Like Enhancer of Split 3 (TLE3), which was recently reported to regulate the balance between osteoblast and adipocyte formation from BMMSCs. We also discuss evidence implicating canonical Wnt signalling, which plays important roles in both adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, in regulating TLE3 expression. Currently, there is demand for new effective therapies that target the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation to enhance bone formation. We speculate that reducing TLE3 expression or activity in BMMSCs could be a useful approach towards increasing osteoblast numbers and reducing adipogenesis in the bone marrow environment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Current cancer therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation and hyperthermic therapy induce acute proteotoxic stress in tumour cells. A major challenge to cancer therapeutic efficacy is the recurrence of therapy-resistant tumours and how to overcome their emergence. The current study examines the concept that tumour cell exposure to acute proteotoxic stress results in the acquisition of a more advanced and aggressive cancer cell phenotype. Specifically, we determined whether heat stress resulted in an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and/or the enhancement of cell migration, components of an advanced and therapeutically resistant cancer phenotype. We identified that heat stress enhanced cell migration in both the lung A549, and breast MDA-MB-468 human adenocarcinoma cell lines, with A549 cells also undergoing a partial EMT. Moreover, in an in vivo model of thermally ablated liver metastases of the mouse colorectal MoCR cell line, immunohistological analysis of classical EMT markers demonstrated a shift to a more mesenchymal phenotype in the surviving tumour fraction, further demonstrating that thermal stress can induce epithelial plasticity. To identify a mechanism by which thermal stress modulates epithelial plasticity, we examined whether the major transcriptional regulator of the heat shock response, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), was a required component. Knockdown of HSF1 in the A549 model did not prevent the associated morphological changes or enhanced migratory profile of heat stressed cells. Therefore, this study provides evidence that heat stress significantly impacts upon cancer cell epithelial plasticity and the migratory phenotype independent of HSF1. These findings further our understanding of novel biological downstream effects of heat stress and their potential independence from the classical heat shock pathway.},

abstract = {Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) comprises a group of rare neuropsychiatric syndromes characterized by iron accumulation in the basal ganglia. The pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) was the first NBIA form to be genetically identified almost 15 years ago. Nowadays, eight types can be genetically distinguished. More recently, a novel NBIA was delineated and termed Static Encephalopathy of childhood with Neurodegeneration in Adulthood (SENDA), characterized by early intellectual disability followed by delayed progressive motor and cognitive deterioration with an onset in the second to third decade. Very recently, mutations in the WD repeat-containing protein 45 (WDR45) gene located on Xp11.23 were shown to be the causal factor. The protein encoded by WDR45 propels protein interaction important for autophagy. This form was therefore retermed Beta-propeller Protein Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN). Here, the first three Dutch patients with genetically proven BPAN are comprehensively described with respect to course and neurological as well as neuropsychiatric phenotypes. All three showed a characteristic delayed progression of neurological symptoms with parkinsonism and prominent dystonia. Treatment with levodopa/carbidopa had limited effects only. Neuropsychiatric symptoms within the autistic and affective spectrum were present in the early phase of the disease. The specific course and prognosis should implicate restrained psychopharmacological interventions.The clinical picture and imaging hallmarks are often highly suggestive and should lead to suspect this specific disorder. However, the identification of a WDR45 mutation is needed for a definite diagnosis of BPAN. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR$\gamma$) regulates adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis, and roles have emerged for this receptor in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer. We report here that induction of the PPAR$\gamma$ activator and adipogenesis forced by overexpression of adipogenic regulatory proteins is blocked upon expression of dominant-negative BRG1 or hBRM, the ATPase subunits of distinct SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzymes. We demonstrate that histone hyperacetylation and the binding of C/EBP activators, polymerase II (Pol II), and general transcription factors (GTFs) initially occurred at the inducible PPAR$\gamma$2 promoter in the absence of SWI/SNF function. However, the polymerase and GTFs were subsequently lost from the promoter in cells expressing dominant-negative SWI/SNF, explaining the inhibition of PPAR$\gamma$2 expression. To corroborate these data, we analyzed interactions at the PPAR$\gamma$2 promoter in differentiating preadipocytes. Changes in promoter structure, histone hyperacetylation, and binding of C/EBP activators, Pol II, and most GTFs preceded the interaction of SWI/SNF enzymes with the PPAR$\gamma$2 promoter. However, transcription of the PPAR$\gamma$2 gene occurred only upon subsequent association of SWI/SNF and TFIIH with the promoter. Thus, induction of the PPAR$\gamma$ nuclear hormone receptor during adipogenesis requires SWI/SNF enzymes to facilitate preinitiation complex function.},

abstract = {Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 80{\%} of all lung cancers. Nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco smoke, can induce proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, and survival in NSCLC cell lines, as well as growth and metastasis of NSCLC in mice. This nicotine-mediated tumor progression is facilitated through activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically the alpha7 subunit; however, how the alpha7 nAChR gene is regulated in lung adenocarcinoma is not fully clear. Here we demonstrate that the alpha7 nAChR gene promoter is differentially regulated by E2F and STAT transcription factors through a competitive interplay; E2F1 induces the promoter, while STAT transcription factors repress it by binding to an overlapping site at a region -294 through -463bp upstream of the transcription start site. Treatment of cells with nicotine induced the mRNA and protein levels of alpha7 nAChR; this could be abrogated by treatment with inhibitors targeting Src, PI3K, MEK, alpha7 nAChR, CDK4/6 or a disruptor of the Rb-Raf-1 interaction. Further, nicotine-mediated induction of alpha7 nAChR was reduced when E2F1 was depleted and in contrast elevated when STAT1 was depleted by siRNAs. Interestingly, extracts from e-cigarettes, which have recently emerged as healthier alternatives to traditional cigarette smoking, can also induce alpha7 nAChR expression in a manner similar to nicotine. These results suggest an autoregulatory feed-forward loop that induces the levels of alpha7 nAChR upon exposure to nicotine, which enhances the strength of the signal. It can be imagined that such an induction of alpha7 nAChR contributes to the tumor-promoting functions of nicotine.},

abstract = {Background:Increasing evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as oncogenes and tumour suppressors to participate in tumour development. However, the roles of miRNAs in chemoresistance of human lung adenocarcinoma (LA) remain largely undefined.Methods:On the basis of miRNA microarray data, miR-224 was identified as the most upregulated miRNA in cisplatin (DDP; cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II)-resistant A549 cells compared with parental A549 cells. The aim of our study was to investigate the roles of miR-224 in the formation of DDP-resistant phenotype of LA cells and its possible molecular mechanisms.Results:Here we showed that miR-224 could promote the in vitro and in vivo DDP resistance of LA cells via regulating G1/S cell cycle transition and apoptosis. p21WAF1/CIP1, a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, was identified as the direct and functional target gene of miR-224. Overexpression of p21WAF1/CIP1could phenocopy the effect of miR-224 downregulation and silencing of p21WAF1/CIP1could partially reverse the effect of miR-224 downregulation on DDP resistance of DDP-resistant LA cells. In addition, miR-224 could affect the G 1/S transition of cell cycle and apoptosis in LA cells through the p21WAF1/CIP1-pRb pathway and the intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway. Furthermore, miR-224 was found to be downregulated in DDP-responding LA tissues, and its expression was inversely correlated with p21WAF1/CIP1. Multivariate analyses indicated that the status of miR-224 might be an independent prognostic factor for predicting the survival of LA patients.Conclusions:Our findings shed novel light on the roles of miR-224/p21WAF1/CIP1signalling in the DDP resistance of LA cells, and targeting it will be a potential strategic approach for reversing the DDP resistance in human LAs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Cancer Research UK.},

abstract = {Developmental programs are controlled by transcription factors and chromatin regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic modification of the genome. These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.},

abstract = {Background: Mechanisms governing the normal resolution processes of inflammation are poorly understood, yet their elucidation may lead to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation. The removal of apoptotic cell material and their potentially histotoxic contents is a prerequisite of resolution. Engulfment by macrophages is an important disposal route, and changes in the apoptotic cells that are associated with their recognition by macrophages are the subject of this report. Methods: Apoptosis and necrosis in primary cells and cell lines were induced by various stimuli. The binding profile of 23 different lectins for vital, apoptotic, and necrotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: We observed that lectins were able to attach to the cell surfaces of vital and dying cells. Some lectins exhibited membrane destructive properties and, consecutively, changed the morphology of the cells as detected by flow cytometry. Other lectins did not show differences in their binding to viable and apoptotic cells. Those lectins were, therefore, not used for analyses of surface changes. The lectins Griffonia simplificolia II (GSL II), Narcissus pseudonarcissus (NPn), and Ulex europaeus I (UEA I) showed no cytotoxic activity and bound preferentially to dying cells. Primary and secondary necrotic cells displayed an equal staining intensity, which was substantially higher than for apoptotic cells. The binding of GSL II, NPn, and UEA to dying cells increased in a timedependent manner and was delayed to AxV positivity and the decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential of apoptotic cells. The kinetic of the lectin staining correlated with the increase in subG1-DNA. GSL II, NPn, and UEA are specific for N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, and fucose, respectively. Conclusion: According to their binding specificity, we conclude that N-acetylglucosamine-, mannose-, and fucose-containing epitopes are increasingly exposed on cells undergoing apoptosis.},

Although the carcinogenicity of high-dose B[a]P has been extensively reported, the effects of long-term B[a]P exposure at lower environmental doses on cancer development are less understood. OBJECTIVES We investigated the impact of B[a]P on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression at various levels of exposure and identified a potential intervention target. METHODS We used a model based on human HCC cells exposed to various concentrations of B[a]P (i.e., 0.01, 1, or 100 nM) for 1 month to examine the effects of B[a]P on cell growth, migration, invasion, and angiogenicity. A bioluminescent murine model was established to assess tumor metastasis in vivo. RESULTS Chronic B[a]P exposure did not alter HCC cell growth but promoted cell migration and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. There was an negative association between B[a]P exposure and the survival of tumor-bearing mice. In addition, B[a]P-treated HCC cells recruited vascular endothelial cells and promoted tumor angiogenesis, possibly through elevating vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. Furthermore, the NF-$\kappa$B pathway may be an adverse outcome pathway associated with the cumulative effects of B[a]P on HCC metastasis. CONCLUSIONS These findings a) indicate that B[a]P has effects on HCC progression; b) identify a possible adverse outcome pathway; and c) contribute to a better understanding of the adverse effects of chronic exposure of B[a]P to human health.},

@article{Diaz-Lopez2014,
abstract = {The microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, 20-22 nucleotides in length, endogenously expressed noncoding RNAs that regulate multiple targets posttranscriptionally. Interestingly, miRNAs have emerged as regulators of most physiological and pathological processes, including metastatic tumor progression, in part by controlling a reversible process called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The activation of EMT increases the migratory and invasive properties fundamental for tumor cell spread while activation of the reverse mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition is required for metastasis outgrowth. The EMT triggering leads to the activation of a core of transcription factors (EMT-TFs) - SNAIL1/SNAIL2, bHLH (E47, E2-2, and TWIST1/TWIST2), and ZEB1/ZEB2 - that act as E-cadherin repressors and, ultimately, coordinate EMT. Recent evidence indicates that several miRNAs regulate the expression of EMT-TFs or EMT-activating signaling pathways. Interestingly, some miRNAs and EMT-TFs form tightly interconnected negative feedback loops that control epithelial cell plasticity, providing self-reinforcing signals and robustness to maintain the epithelial or mesenchymal cell status. Among the most significant feedback loops, we focus on the ZEB/miR-200 and the SNAIL1/miR-34 networks that hold a clear impact in the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal state. Recent insights into the p53 modulation of the EMT-TF/miRNA loops and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the context of metastasis dissemination will also be discussed. Understanding the regulation of EMT by miRNAs opens new avenues for the diagnosis and prognosis of tumors and identifies potential therapeutic targets that might help to negatively impact on metastasis dissemination and increasing patient survival.},

abstract = {Computational models of enhancer function generally assume that transcription factors (TFs) exert their regulatory effects independently, modeling an enhancer as a “bag of sites.” These models fail on endogenous loci that harbor multiple enhancers, and a “two-tier” model appears better suited: in each enhancer TFs work independently, and the total expression is a weighted sum of their expression readouts. Here, we test these two opposing views on how cis-regulatory information is integrated. We fused two Drosophila blastoderm enhancers, measured their readouts, and applied the above two models to these data. The two-tier mechanism better fits these readouts, suggesting that these fused enhancers comprise multiple independent modules, despite having sequence characteristics typical of single enhancers. We show that short-range TF-TF interactions are not sufficient to designate such modules, suggesting unknown underlying mechanisms. Our results underscore that mechanisms of how modules are defined and how their outputs are combined remain to be elucidated. Samee et al. identify a gap in our current assumptions of how regulatory sequences control gene expression. It is generally assumed that regulatory sequences act as single modules on transcriptional machinery. Quantitative modeling of a set of synthetic regulatory sequences challenges this assumption.},

abstract = {Background Cholesterol in lipid raft plays crucial role on cancer cell survival during metastasis of cancer cells. Cancer cells are reported to enrich cholesterol in lipid raft which make them more susceptible to cell death after cholesterol depletion than normal cells. Methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin (M$\beta$CD), an amphipathic polysaccharide known to deplete the membrane cholesterol, induces cell death selectively in cancer cells. Present work was designed to identify the major form of programmed cell death in membrane cholesterol depleted cancer cells (MDA-MB 231 and 4T1) and its impact on migration efficiency of cancer cells. Methods Membrane cholesterol alteration and morphological changes in 4T1 and MDA-MB 231 cancer cells by M$\beta$CD were measured by fluorescent microscopy. Cell death and cell proliferation were observed by PI, AO/EB and MTT assay respectively. Programme cell death was confirmed by flow cytometer. Caspase activation was assessed by MTT and PI after treatments with Z-VAD [OME]-FMK, mitomycin c and cycloheximide. Necroptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis and paraptosis were examined by cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry. Relative quantitation of mRNA of caspase-8, necroptosis and autophagy genes were performed. Migration efficiency of cancer cells were determined by wound healing assay. Results We found caspase independent cell death in cholesterol depleted MDA-MB 231 cells which was reduced by (3-MA) an autophagy inhibitor. Membrane cholesterol depletion neither induces necroptosis, paraptosis nor pyroptosis in MDA-MB 231 cells. Subsequent activation of caspase-8 after co-incubation of mitomycin c and cycloheximide separately, restored the cell viability in cholesterol depleted MDA-MB 231 cells. Down regulation of caspase-8 mRNA in cholesterol depleted cancer cells ensures that caspase-8 indirectly promotes the induction of autophagy. In another experiment we have demonstrated that membrane cholesterol depletion reduces the migration efficiency in cancer cells. Conclusion Together our experimental data suggests that membrane cholesterol is the crucial for the recruitment and activation of caspase-8 as well as its non-apoptotic functions in cancer cells. Enriched cholesterol in lipid raft of cancer cells may be regulating the cross talk between caspase-8 and autophagy machineries to promote their survival and migration. Therefore it can be explored to understand and address the issues of chemotherapeutic and drugs resistance.},

Therefore, BPA, BPF and BPS have been added at 10 nM or 10 $\mu$M during the differentiation of human primary adipocytes from subcutaneous fat of three non-diabetic Caucasian female patients. Gene expression (mRNA/lncRNA) arrays and microRNA arrays, have been used to assess coding and non-coding RNA changes. We detected significantly deregulated mRNA/lncRNA and miRNA at low and high doses. Enrichment in "cancer" and "organismal injury and abnormalities" related pathways was found in response to the three products. Some long intergenic non-coding RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs were differentially expressed suggesting that bisphenols may also activate multiple cellular processes and epigenetic modifications. The analysis of upstream regulators of deregulated genes highlighted hormones or hormone-like chemicals suggesting that BPS and BPF can be suspected to interfere, just like BPA, with hormonal regulation and have to be considered as endocrine disruptors. All these results suggest that as BPA, its substitutes BPS and BPF should be used with the same restrictions.},

abstract = {Oxidative DNA damage induces genomic instability and may lead to mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. As severe blockades to RNA polymerase II (RNA POLII) during transcription, oxidative DNA damage and the associated DNA strand breaks have a profoundly deleterious impact on cell survival. To protect the integrity of coding regions, high fidelity DNA repair at a transcriptionally active site in non-dividing somatic cells, (i.e., terminally differentiated and quiescent/G0 cells) is necessary to maintain the sequence integrity of transcribed regions. Recent studies indicate that an RNA-templated, transcription-associated recombination mechanism is important to protect coding regions from DNA damage-induced genomic instability. Here, we describe the discovery that G1/G0 cells exhibit Cockayne syndrome (CS) B (CSB)-dependent assembly of homologous recombination (HR) factors at double strand break (DSB) sites within actively transcribed regions. This discovery is a challenge to the current dogma that HR occurs only in S/G2 cells where undamaged sister chromatids are available as donor templates.},

abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key event in the generation of invasive tumor cells. A hallmark of EMT is the repression of E-cadherin expression, which is regulated by various signal transduction pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Wnt. These pathways are highly interconnected via multiple coupled feedback loops (CFL). As the function of such coupled feedback regulations is difficult to analyze experimentally, we used a systems biology approach where computational models were designed to predict biological effects that result from the complex interplay of CFLs. Using epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Wnt as input and E-cadherin transcriptional regulation as output, we established an ordinary differential equation model of the ERK and Wnt signaling network containing six feedback links and used extensive computer simulations to analyze the effects of these feedback links in isolation and different combinations. The results show that the feedbacks can generate a rich dynamic behavior leading to various dose-response patterns and have a decisive role in determining network responses to EGF and Wnt. In particular, we made two important findings: first, that coupled positive feedback loops composed of phosphorylation of Raf kinase inhibitor RKIP by ERK and transcriptional repression of RKIP by Snail have an essential role in causing a switch-like behavior of E-cadherin expression; and second, that RKIP expression inhibits EMT progression by preventing E-cadherin suppression. Taken together, our findings provide us with a system-level understanding of how RKIP can regulate EMT progression and may explain why RKIP is downregulated in so many metastatic cancer cells.},

abstract = {Trans-10, cis-12 (t10c12) conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) reduces lipid levels in adipocytes, but the mechanisms involved are still emerging. The hypotheses of this study were that t10c12 CLA treatment activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and that the effectiveness of a low dose of t10c12 CLA would be increased when combined with an AMPK activator. We demonstrated t10c12 CLA, directly or indirectly, activated AMPK and increased the amount of phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Compound C, a potent inhibitor of AMPK, attenuated the phosphorylation of ACC, integrated stress response (ISR), inflammatory response, reduction in key lipogenic transcription factors, and triglyceride (TG) reduction that otherwise occurred in t10c12 CLA-treated adipocytes. Treatment of adipocytes or mice with a low dose of t10c12 CLA in conjunction with the AMPK activator metformin resulted in more TG loss than treatment with the individual chemicals. Additionally, although an inflammatory response was required for robust TG reduction, the combination of t10c12 CLA with AMPK activators had a similar TG loss with a reduced inflammatory response. A microarray analysis of the transcriptional response to either t10c12 CLA, metformin, or the combination, indicated the responses were very similar, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 or better for genes in the ISR or lipid-related pathways. Altogether, these results support our hypotheses that t10c12 CLA activates AMPK, directly or indirectly, and that metformin increases the effectiveness of t10c12 CLA in reducing TG amounts in adipocytes.},

Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(m d log n) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m {\~{}} n and d {\~{}} log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(n log{\^{}}2 n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web-site of a large online retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400,000 vertices and 2 million edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

abstract = {Locating the root-node of the "tree of life" (ToL) is one of the hardest problems in phylogenetics. The root-node or the universal common ancestor (UCA) divides the descendants into organismal domains. Two notable variants of the two-domains ToL (2D-ToL) have gained support recently, though, Williams and colleagues (W{\&}C) claim that one is better supported than the other. Here, we argue that important aspects of estimating evolutionary relatedness and assessing phylogenetic signal in empirical data were overlooked. We focus on phylogenetic character reconstructions necessary to describe the UCA or its closest descendants in the absence of reliable fossils. It is well known that different character-types present different perspectives on evolutionary history that relate to different phylogenetic depths. Which of the 2D-ToL hypotheses is better supported depends on which kind of molecular features -- protein-domains or their component amino-acids -- are better for resolving the common ancestors (CA) at the roots of clades. In practice, this involves reconstructing character compositions of the ancestral nodes all the way back to the UCA.},

abstract = {Myofibroblasts play critical roles in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by depositing components of extracellular matrix. One source of lung myofibroblasts is thought to be alveolar epithelial type 2 cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Rat RLE-6TN alveolar epithelial type 2 cells treated with transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1) are converted into myofibroblasts through EMT. TGF-$\beta$ induces both canonical Smad signaling and non-canonical signaling, including the Ras-induced ERK pathway (Raf-MEK-ERK). However, the signaling mechanisms regulating TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT are not fully understood. Here, we show that the Ras-ERK pathway negatively regulates TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT in RLE-6TN cells and that DA-Raf1 (DA-Raf), a splicing isoform of A-Raf and a dominant-negative antagonist of the Ras-ERK pathway, plays an essential role in EMT. Stimulation of the cells with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which activated the ERK pathway, prominently suppressed TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT. An inhibitor of MEK, but not an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, rescued the TGF-$\beta$1-treated cells from the suppression of EMT by FGF2. Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of a component of the Ras-ERK pathway, i.e., H-Ras, B-Raf, or MEK1, interfered with EMT. Knockdown of DA-Raf expression with siRNAs facilitated the activity of MEK and ERK, which were only weakly and transiently activated by TGF-$\beta$1. Although DA-Raf knockdown abrogated TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT, the abrogation of EMT was reversed by the addition of the MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, DA-Raf knockdown impaired the TGF-$\beta$1-induced nuclear translocation of Smad2, which mediates the transcription required for EMT. These results imply that intrinsic DA-Raf exerts essential functions for EMT by antagonizing the TGF-$\beta$1-induced Ras-ERK pathway in RLE-6TN cells.},

XOR lies downstream of C/EBPbeta and upstream of PPARgamma, in the cascade of factors that control adipogenesis, and it regulates PPARgamma activity. In vitro, knockdown of XOR inhibits adipogenesis and PPARgamma activity while constitutive overexpression increases activity of the PPARgamma receptor in both adipocytes and preadipocytes. In vivo, XOR -/- mice demonstrate 50{\%} reduction in adipose mass versus wild-type littermates while obese ob/ob mice exhibit increased concentrations of XOR mRNA and urate in the adipose tissue.

We tested the hypothesis that an aberrantly increased NO-release enhances the development and progression of PDAC. Enhanced NOS2 expression in tumors significantly associated with poor survival in PDAC patients (N = 107) with validation in independent cohorts. We then genetically targeted NOS2 in an autochthonous mouse model of PDAC to examine the effect of NOS2-deficiency on disease progression and survival. Genetic ablation of NOS2 significantly prolonged survival and reduced tumor severity in LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H/+; Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mice. Primary tumor cells isolated from NOS2-deficient KPC (NKPC) mice showed decreased proliferation and invasiveness as compared to those from KPC mice. Furthermore, NKPC tumors showed reduced expression of pERK, a diminished inactivation of Forkhead box transcription factor O (FOXO3), a tumor suppressor, and a decrease in the expression of oncomir-21, when compared with tumors in KPC mice. Taken together, these findings showed that NOS2 is a predictor of prognosis in early stage, resected PDAC patients, and provide proof-of-principle that targeting NOS2 may have potential therapeutic value in this lethal malignancy.},

To identify tamoxifen response-related microRNAs (miRNAs) in breast cancer, MCF-7 cells infected with a lentiviral miRNA library were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) or vehicle for 4 weeks, and the amounts of individual miRNA precursors that had integrated into the genome were evaluated by microarray. Compared to the vehicle-treated cells, 5 'dropout' miRNAs, which were downregulated in OHT-treated cells, and 6 'retained' miRNAs, which were upregulated in OHT-treated cells, were identified. Of the dropout miRNAs, we found that miR-574-3p expression was downregulated in clinical breast cancer tissues as compared with their paired adjacent tissues. In addition, anti-miR-574-3p reversed tamoxifen-mediated suppression of MCF-7 cell growth. Clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) was identified as a miR-574-3p target gene by in silico algorithms and luciferase reporter assay using the 3' untranslated region of CLTC mRNA. Interestingly, loss and gain of miR-574-3p function in MCF-7 cells causes CLTC to be upregulated and downregulated, respectively. These results suggest that functional screening mediated by miRNA libraries can provide new insights into the genes essential for tamoxifen response in breast cancer.},

In this study, we report evidence demonstrating that OATL1, a putative Rab guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP), is a novel binding partner of Atg8 homologues in mammalian cells. OATL1 is recruited to isolation membranes and autophagosomes through direct interaction with Atg8 homologues and is involved in the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes through its GAP activity. We further provide evidence that Rab33B, an Atg16L1-binding protein, is a target substrate of OATL1 and is involved in the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, the same as OATL1. Because both its GAP activity and its Atg8 homologue-binding activity are required for OATL1 to function, we propose a model that OATL1 uses Atg8 homologues as a scaffold to exert its GAP activity and to regulate autophagosomal maturation.},

As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we present a comprehensive molecular analysis of 333 primary prostate carcinomas. Our results revealed a molecular taxonomy in which 74{\%} of these tumors fell into one of seven subtypes defined by specific gene fusions (ERG, ETV1/4, and FLI1) or mutations (SPOP, FOXA1, and IDH1). Epigenetic profiles showed substantial heterogeneity, including an IDH1 mutant subset with a methylator phenotype. Androgen receptor (AR) activity varied widely and in a subtype-specific manner, with SPOP and FOXA1 mutant tumors having the highest levels of AR-induced transcripts. 25{\%} of the prostate cancers had a presumed actionable lesion in the PI3K or MAPK signaling pathways, and DNA repair genes were inactivated in 19{\%}. Our analysis reveals molecular heterogeneity among primary prostate cancers, as well as potentially actionable molecular defects.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy is a dynamic process involving the rearrangement of subcellular membranes to sequester cytoplasm and organelles for delivery to the lysosome or vacuole where the sequestered cargo is degraded and recycled. This process takes place in all eukaryotic cells. It is highly regulated through the action of various kinases, phosphatases, and guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). The core protein machinery that is necessary to drive formation and consumption of intermediates in the macroautophagy pathway includes a ubiquitin-like protein conjugation system and a protein complex that directs membrane docking and fusion at the lysosome or vacuole. Macroautophagy plays an important role in developmental processes, human disease, and cellular response to nutrient deprivation.},

abstract = {In the present work we extend and analyze the scope of our recently proposed stochastic model for transcriptional regulation, which considers an arbitrarily complex cis-regulatory system using only elementary reactions. Previously, we determined the role of cooperativity on the intrinsic fluctuations of gene expression for activating transcriptional switches, by means of master equation formalism and computer simulation. This model allowed us to distinguish between two cooperative binding mechanisms and, even though the mean expression levels were not affected differently by the acting mechanism, we showed that the associated fluctuations were different. In the present generalized model we include other regulatory functions in addition to those associated to an activator switch. Namely, we introduce repressive regulatory functions and two theoretical mechanisms that account for the biphasic response that some cis-regulatory systems show to the transcription factor concentration. We have also extended our previous master equation formalism in order to include protein production by stochastic translation of mRNA. Furthermore, we examine the graded/binary scenarios in the context of the interaction energy between transcription factors. In this sense, this is the first report to show that the cooperative binding of transcription factors to DNA promotes the "all-or-none" phenomenon observed in eukaryotic systems. In addition, we confirm that gene expression fluctuation levels associated with one of two cooperative binding mechanism never exceed the fluctuation levels of the other. {\textcopyright} 2012 Gutierrez et al.},

abstract = {Increasingly, cancers are being diagnosed at an early stage. Leukoplakia, a precancerous lesion, progresses to cancer in 5-10{\%} of cases. We performed genetic analysis using cDNA microarray and immunohistochemistry in 6 patients, 3 with precancerous lesions and 3 with early tongue cancer, to evaluate the usefulness of these methods in the diagnosis of precancerous lesions and early cancer. Samples of normal epithelium, epithelial dysplasia, and cancer tissues were collected by laser microdissection, RNA was extracted, and the signals converted to numerical values. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibody against phospho AKT (p-AKT), a component of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signal pathway. Five genes showed a 2 times or greater level of increase in expression in epithelial tissue in comparison with in normal tissue, while 4 genes showed a 2 times or greater increase in early cancer tissues. In cancer tissues and epithelial dysplasia tissues, PI3K class III was expressed at 2.5 times and 11 times the level of that found in normal tissue, respectively. Histochemistry using p-AKT antibody revealed no positive cells in normal tissue. Positive cells were noted in the basal and parabasal cell layers, and partially in the spinous layer of epithelial dysplasia tissues, and in the spinous layer of early cancer tissues. These findings suggest that activation of the PI3K-AKT signal pathway is associated with oral carcinogenesis.},

Correlated activity patterns of these elements reveal a functional regulatory network, which predicts putative new functions for genes, reveals stage- and tissue-specific regulators, and enables gene-expression prediction.

abstract = {The physiological functions of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) include vasorelaxation, stimulation of cellular bioenergetics, and promotion of angiogenesis. Analysis of human colon cancer biopsies and patient-matched normal margin mucosa revealed the selective up-regulation of the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine-$\beta$-synthase (CBS) in colon cancer, resulting in an increased rate of H2S production. Similarly, colon cancer-derived epithelial cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, LoVo) exhibited selective CBS up-regulation and increased H2S production, compared with the nonmalignant colonic mucosa cells, NCM356. CBS localized to the cytosol, as well as the mitochondrial outer membrane. ShRNA-mediated silencing of CBS or its pharmacological inhibition with aminooxyacetic acid reduced HCT116 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; reduced endothelial cell migration in tumor/endothelial cell cocultures; and suppressed mitochondrial function (oxygen consumption, ATP turnover, and respiratory reserve capacity), as well as glycolysis. Treatment of nude mice with aminooxyacetic acid attenuated the growth of patient-derived colon cancer xenografts and reduced tumor blood flow. Similarly, CBS silencing of the tumor cells decreased xenograft growth and suppressed neovessel density, suggesting a role for endogenous H2S in tumor angiogenesis. In contrast to CBS, silencing of cystathionine-$\gamma$-lyase (the expression of which was unchanged in colon cancer) did not affect tumor growth or bioenergetics. In conclusion, H2S produced from CBS serves to (i) maintain colon cancer cellular bioenergetics, thereby supporting tumor growth and proliferation, and (ii) promote angiogenesis and vasorelaxation, consequently providing the tumor with blood and nutritients. The current findings identify CBS-derived H2S as a tumor growth factor and anticancer drug target.},

Rab GTPases are central for autophagy but their regulation especially through the activity of Rab GEFs remains largely elusive. We employed a RNAi screen simultaneously monitoring different populations of autophagosomes and identified 34 out of 186 Rab GTPase, GAP and GEF family members as potential autophagy regulators, amongst them SMCR8. SMCR8 uses overlapping binding regions to associate with C9ORF72 or with a C9ORF72-ULK1 kinase complex holo-assembly, which function in maturation and formation of autophagosomes, respectively. While focusing on the role of SMCR8 during autophagy initiation, we found that kinase activity and gene expression of ULK1 are increased upon SMCR8 depletion. The latter phenotype involved association of SMCR8 with the ULK1 gene locus. Global mRNA expression analysis revealed that SMCR8 regulates transcription of several other autophagy genes including WIPI2. Collectively, we established SMCR8 as multifaceted negative autophagy regulator.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This is due to metastatic disease, which represents a challenge for treatment. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of metastasis is, therefore, of paramount importance. In this review we summarize the role of micro RNAs (miRs) involved in metastasis of breast cancer. We present an overview on metastasis-promoting, -suppressing and context-dependent miRs with both activities. We have categorized the corresponding miRs according to their target classes, interaction with stromal cells or exosomes. The pathways affected by individual miRs are outlined in regard to in vitro properties, activity in metastasis-related in vivo models and clinical significance. Current approaches that may be suitable for therapeutic inhibition or restauration of miR activity are outlined. Finally, we discuss the delivery bottlenecks which present as a major challenge in nucleic acid (miR)-based therapies.},

abstract = {1. 1 Welcome to ggplot2 ggplot2 is an R package for producing statistical, or data, graphics, but it is unlike most other graphics packages because it has a deep underlying grammar. This grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson, 2005), is composed of a set of independent components that can be composed in many di?erent ways. This makesggplot2 very powerful, because you are not limited to a set of pre-speci?ed graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem. This may sound overwhelming, but because there is a simple set of core principles and very few special cases, ggplot2 is also easy to learn (although it may take a little time to forget your preconceptions from other graphics tools). Practically,ggplot2 provides beautiful, hassle-free plots, that take care of ?ddly details like drawing legends. The plots can be built up iteratively and edited later. A carefully chosen set of defaults means that most of the time you can produce a publication-quality graphic in seconds, but if you do have special formatting requirements, a comprehensive theming system makes it easy to do what you want. Instead of spending time making your graph look pretty, you can focus on creating a graph that best reveals the messages in your data.},

Attempts to reveal such neural information flow have been made using linear computational methods, but neural interactions are known to be nonlinear. Here, we demonstrate that a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) inference algorithm we originally developed to infer nonlinear transcriptional regulatory networks from gene expression data collected with microarrays is also successful at inferring nonlinear neural information flow networks from electrophysiology data collected with microelectrode arrays. The inferred networks we recover from the songbird auditory pathway are correctly restricted to a subset of known anatomical paths, are consistent with timing of the system, and reveal both the importance of reciprocal feedback in auditory processing and greater information flow to higher-order auditory areas when birds hear natural as opposed to synthetic sounds. A linear method applied to the same data incorrectly produces networks with information flow to non-neural tissue and over paths known not to exist. To our knowledge, this study represents the first biologically validated demonstration of an algorithm to successfully infer neural information flow networks.},

abstract = {It has recently been proposed that the TBC (Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain functions as a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) domain for small GTPase Rab. Because of the large number of Rab proteins in mammals, however, most TBC domains have never been investigated for Rab-GAP activity. In this study we established panels of the GTP-fixed form of 60 different Rabs constructed in pGAD-C1, a yeast two-hybrid bait vector. We also constructed a yeast two-hybrid prey vector (pGBDU-C1) that harbors the cDNA of 40 distinct TBC proteins. Systematic investigation of 2400 combinations of 60 GTP-fixed Rabs and 40 TBC proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that seven TBC proteins specifically and differentially interact with specific Rabs (e.g. OATL1 interacts with Rab2A; FLJ12085 with Rab5A/B/C; and Evi5-like with Rab10). Measurement of in vitro Rab-GAP activity revealed that OATL1 and Evi5-like actually possess significant Rab2A- and Rab10-GAP activity, respectively, but that FLJ12085 do not display Rab5A-GAP activity at all. These results indicate that specific interaction between TBC protein and Rab would be a useful indicator for screening for the target Rabs of some TBC/Rab-GAP domains, but that there is little correlation between the Rab-binding activity and Rab-GAP activity of other TBC proteins.},

abstract = {Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) models seek to describe the temporal pattern of drug exposures and their associated pharmacological effects produced at micro- and macro-scales of organization. Antibody-based drugs have been developed for a large variety of diseases, with effects exhibited through a comprehensive range of mechanisms of action. Mechanism-based PK/PD and systems pharmacology models can play a major role in elucidating and integrating complex antibody pharmacological properties, such as nonlinear disposition and dynamical intracellular signaling pathways triggered by ligation to their cognate targets. Such complexities can be addressed through the use of robust computational modeling techniques that have proven powerful tools for pragmatic characterization of experimental data and for theoretical exploration of antibody efficacy and adverse effects. The primary objectives of such multi-scale mathematical models are to generate and test competing hypotheses and to predict clinical outcomes. In this review, relevant systems pharmacology and enhanced PD (ePD) models that are used as predictive tools for antibody-based drug action are reported. Their common conceptual features are highlighted, along with approaches used for modeling preclinical and clinically available data. Key examples illustrate how systems pharmacology and ePD models codify the interplay among complex biology, drug concentrations, and pharmacological effects. New hybrid modeling concepts that bridge cutting-edge systems pharmacology models with established PK/ePD models will be needed to anticipate antibody effects on disease in subpopulations and individual patients.},

abstract = {The Beclin 1–Vps34 complex, known as “mammalian class III PI3K,”
plays essential roles in membrane-mediated transport processes
including autophagy and endosomal trafficking. Beclin 1 acts as a
scaffolding molecule for the complex and readily transits from its
metastable homodimeric state to interact with key modulators such
as Atg14L or UVRAG and form functionally distinct Atg14L/UVRAGcontaining
Beclin 1–Vps34 subcomplexes. The Beclin 1–Atg14L/
UVRAG interaction relies critically on their coiled-coil domains, but
the molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. We determined
the crystal structure of Beclin 1–UVRAG coiled-coil complex
and identified a strengthened interface with both hydrophobic pairings
and electrostatically complementary interactions. This structure
explains why the Beclin 1–UVRAG interaction is more potent than
the metastable Beclin 1 homodimer. Potent Beclin 1–UVRAG interaction
is functionally significant because it renders UVRAG more
competitive than Atg14L in Beclin 1 binding and is critical for promoting
endolysosomal trafficking. UVRAG coiled-coil mutants with
weakened Beclin 1 binding do not outcompete Atg14L and fail to
promote endolysosomal degradation of the EGF receptor (EGFR).
We designed all-hydrocarbon stapled peptides that specifically targeted
the C-terminal part of the Beclin 1 coiled-coil domain to interfere
with its homodimerization. One such peptide reduced Beclin
1 self-association, promoted Beclin 1–Atg14L/UVRAG interaction, increased
autophagic flux, and enhanced EGFR degradation. Our results
demonstrate that the targeting Beclin 1 coiled-coil domain with
designed peptides to induce the redistribution of Beclin 1 among its
self-associated form or Atg14L/UVRAG-containing complexes enhances
both autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking.},

In contrast, a few reports have also indicated the tumor-suppressing role of LOX. In this short review, we discuss recent research on the correlations between LOX and cancer.

Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) have been considered a potential treatment modality for fracture healing, however, the mechanism of their action remains unclear. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling may affect osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. This study aimed to assess the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) under PEMF stimulation and the potential involvement of mTOR signaling pathway in this process. PEMFs were generated by a novel miniaturized electromagnetic device. Potential changes in the expression of mTOR pathway components, including receptors, ligands and nuclear target genes, and their correlation with osteogenic markers and transcription factors were analyzed. Involvement of the mTOR pathway in osteogenesis was also studied in the presence of proinflammatory mediators. PEMF exposure increased cell proliferation and adhesion and the osteogenic commitment of MSCs even in inflammatory conditions. Osteogenic-related genes were over-expressed following PEMF treatment. Our results  confirm that PEMFs contribute to activation of the mTOR pathway via upregulation of the proteins AKT, MAPP kinase, and RRAGA, suggesting that activation of the mTOR pathway is required for PEMF-stimulated osteogenic differentiation. Our findings provide insights into how PEMFs influence osteogenic differentiation in normal and inflammatory environments.},

abstract = {Hyperphosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been found in various types of human cancers, including head and neck cancer (HNC). Although smoking is critical in the development and progression of HNC, how tobacco components activate STAT3 is unclear. We demonstrated that exposure of HNC cell lines to a tobacco extract induced a rapid Y705 phosphorylation of STAT3 and a rapid increase in the SUMO protease SENP3 that depended on a simultaneous increase in reactive oxygen species. We identified that SUMOylation at the lysine 451 site facilitated STAT3 binding to the phosphatase TC45 through an SUMO-interacting motif of TC45. SENP3 could thus enhance STAT3 phosphorylation by de-conjugating the SUMO2/3 modification of STAT3. Knocking-down of SENP3 greatly impaired basal and induced STAT3 phosphorylation by tobacco extract or interleukin 6. A correlation between SENP3 protein levels and STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation levels in human laryngeal carcinoma specimens was found, which was more significant in the specimens derived from the smoker patients and with poor clinicopathological parameters. Our data identified SUMOylation as a previously undescribed post-translational modification of STAT3 and SENP3 as a critical positive modulator of tobacco- or cytokine-induced STAT3 activation. These findings provide novel insights into the hyperphosphorylation of STAT3 in development of HNC.},

Therefore, identification of metastasis-associated biomarkers and therapeutic targets will contribute a lot to improving melanoma theranostics. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in modulating cancer invasion and metastasis, and are proved as potential non-invasive biomarkers in sera for various tumors. Here, we reported miR-23a as a novel metastasis-associated miRNA that played a remarkable role in modulating melanoma invasive and metastatic capacity and was of great value in predicting melanoma metastasis and prognosis. We found that serum miR-23a level was significantly down-regulated in metastatic melanoma patients and highly correlated with poor clinical outcomes. In addition, miR-23a level was also remarkably decreased in metastatic melanoma tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, overexpressed miR-23a suppressed the invasive and migratory property of melanoma cells by abrogating autophagy through directly targeting ATG12. Specially, miR-23a-ATG12 axis attenuated melanoma invasion and migration through autophagy-mediated AMPK-RhoA pathway. Finally, the overexpression of miR-23a prevented melanoma metastasis in vivo. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the metastasis-associated miR-23a is not only a potential biomarker, but also a valuable therapeutic target for melanoma.},

A master regulator of these functions is phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), a phospholipid synthesized primarily by class III PI 3-kinase Vps34. Here we report that disruption of neuronal Vps34 function in vitro and in vivo impairs autophagy, lysosomal degradation as well as lipid metabolism, causing endolysosomal membrane damage. PI3P deficiency also promotes secretion of unique exosomes enriched for undigested lysosomal substrates, including amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), specific sphingolipids, and the phospholipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), which normally resides in the internal vesicles of endolysosomes. Secretion of these exosomes requires neutral sphingomyelinase 2 and sphingolipid synthesis. Our results reveal a homeostatic response counteracting lysosomal dysfunction via secretion of atypical exosomes eliminating lysosomal waste and define exosomal APP-CTFs and BMP as candidate biomarkers for endolysosomal dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {To evaluate the effect of CG methylation on DNA binding of sequence-specific B-ZIP transcription factors (TFs) in a high-throughput manner, we enzymatically methylated the cytosine in the CG dinucleotide on protein binding microarrays. Two Agilent DNA array designs were used. One contained 40,000 features using de Bruijn sequences where each 8-mer occurs 32 times in various positions in the DNA sequence. The second contained 180,000 features with each CG containing 8-mer occurring three times. The first design was better for identification of binding motifs, while the second was better for quantification. Using this novel technology, we show that CG methylation enhanced binding for CEBPA and CEBPB and inhibited binding for CREB, ATF4, JUN, JUND, CEBPD, and CEBPG. The CEBPB|ATF4 heterodimer bound a novel motif CGAT|GCAA 10-fold better when methylated. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed these results. CEBPB ChIP-seq data using primary female mouse dermal fibroblasts with 50× methylome coverage for each strand indicate that the methylated sequences well-bound on the arrays are also bound in vivo. CEBPB bound 39{\%} of the methylated canonical 10-mers ATTGC|GCAAT in the mouse genome. After ATF4 protein induction by thapsigargin which results in ER stress, CEBPB binds methylated CGAT|GCAA in vivo, recapitulating what was observed on the arrays. This methodology can be used to identify new methylated DNA sequences preferentially bound by TFs, which may be functional in vivo.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cellular behaviors are governed by interaction networks among biomolecules, for example gene regulatory and signal transduction networks. An often used dynamic modeling framework for these networks, Boolean modeling, can obtain their attractors (which correspond to cell types and behaviors) and their trajectories from an initial state (e.g. a resting state) to the attractors, for example in response to an external signal. The existing methods however do not elucidate the causal relationships between distant nodes in the network. RESULTS In this work, we propose a simple logic framework, based on categorizing causal relationships as sufficient or necessary, as a complement to Boolean networks. We identify and explore the properties of complex subnetworks that are distillable into a single logic relationship. We also identify cyclic subnetworks that ensure the stabilization of the state of participating nodes regardless of the rest of the network. We identify the logic backbone of biomolecular networks, consisting of external signals, self-sustaining cyclic subnetworks (stable motifs), and output nodes. Furthermore, we use the logic framework to identify crucial nodes whose override can drive the system from one steady state to another. We apply these techniques to two biological networks: the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition network corresponding to a developmental process exploited in tumor invasion, and the network of abscisic acid induced stomatal closure in plants. We find interesting subnetworks with logical implications in these networks. Using these subgraphs and motifs, we efficiently reduce both networks to succinct backbone structures. CONCLUSIONS The logic representation identifies the causal relationships between distant nodes and subnetworks. This knowledge can form the basis of network control or used in the reverse engineering of networks.},

abstract = {microRNAs constitute a complex class of pleiotropic post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression involved in the control of several physiologic and pathologic processes. Their mechanism of action is primarily based on the imperfect matching of a seed region located at the 5' end of a 21-23 nt sequence with a partially complementary sequence located in the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs. This leads to inhibition of mRNA translation and eventually to its degradation. Individual miRNAs are capable of binding to several mRNAs and several miRNAs are capable of influencing the function of the same mRNAs. In recent years networks of miRNAs are emerging as capable of controlling key signaling pathways responsible for the growth and propagation of cancer cells. Furthermore several examples have been provided which highlight the involvement of miRNAs in the development of resistance to targeted drug therapies. In this review we provide an updated overview of the role of miRNAs in the development of melanoma and the identification of the main downstream pathways controlled by these miRNAs. Furthermore we discuss a group of miRNAs capable to influence through their respective up- or down-modulation the development of resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.},

abstract = {Regulation of gene expression requires both transcription factor (TFs) and epigenetic modifications, and interplays between the two types of factors have been discovered. However study of relationships between chromatin features and TF-TF co-occupancy remains limited. Here, we revealed the relationship by first illustrating distinct profile patterns of chromatin features related to different binding events, including single TF binding and TF-TF co-occupancy of 71 TFs from five human cell lines. We further implemented statistical analyses to demonstrate the relationship by accurately predicting co-occupancy genome-widely using chromatin features including DNase I hypersensitivity, 11 histone modifications (HMs) and GC content. Remarkably, our results showed that the combination of chromatin features enables accurate predictions across the five cells. For individual chromatin features, DNase I enables high and consistent predictions. H3K27ac, H3K4me 2, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac are more reliable predictors than other HMs. Although the combination of 11 HMs achieves accurate predictions, their predictive ability varies considerably when a model obtained from one cell is applied to others, indicating relationship between HMs and TF-TF co-occupancy is cell type dependent. GC content is not a reliable predictor, but the addition of GC content to any other features enhances their predictive ability. Together, our results elucidate a strong relationship between TF-TF co-occupancy and chromatin features.},

abstract = {Retromer is a membrane-associated heteropentameric coat complex that functions in the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, the Wntless protein and other membrane proteins of physiological significance. Retromer comprises two functional subcomplexes: the cargo-selective subcomplex is a trimer of the VPS35, VPS29, VPS26 proteins, whereas the sorting nexin proteins, Snx1 and Snx2 function to tubulate the endosomal membrane. Unlike the sorting nexins, which contain PtdIns3P-binding PX domains, the cargo-selective VPS35/29/26 complex has no lipid-binding domains and its recruitment to the endosomal membrane remains mechanistically uncharacterised. In this study we show that the VPS35/29/26 complex interacts with the small GTPase Rab7 and requires Rab7 for its recruitment to the endosome. We show that the Rab7K157N mutant that causes the peripheral neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, does not interact with the VPS35/29/26 complex, resulting in a weakened association with the membrane. We have also identified a novel retromer-interacting protein, TBC1D5, which is a member of the Rab GAP family of proteins that negatively regulates VPS35/29/26 recruitment and causes Rab7 to dissociate from the membrane. We therefore propose that recruitment of the cargo-selective VPS35/29/26 complex is catalysed by Rab7 and inhibited by the Rab-GAP protein, TBC1D5.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Adipocyte differentiation and function relies on a network of transcription factors, which is disrupted in obesity-associated low grade, chronic inflammation leading to adipose tissue dysfunction. In this context, there is a need for a thorough understanding of the transcriptional regulatory network involved in adipose tissue pathophysiology. Recent advances in the functional annotation of the genome has highlighted the role of non-coding RNAs in cellular differentiation processes in coordination with transcription factors. Using an unbiased genome-wide approach, we identified and characterized a novel long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) strongly induced during adipocyte differentiation. This lincRNA favors adipocyte differentiation and coactivates the master adipogenic regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR$\gamma$) through interaction with the paraspeckle component and hnRNP-like RNA binding protein 14 (RBM14/NCoAA), and was therefore called PPAR$\gamma$-activator RBM14-associated lncRNA (Paral1). Paral1 expression is restricted to adipocytes and decreased in humans with increasing body mass index. A decreased expression was also observed in diet-induced or genetic mouse models of obesity and this down-regulation was mimicked in vitro by TNF treatment. In conclusion, we have identified a novel component of the adipogenic transcriptional regulatory network defining the lincRNA Paral1 as an obesity-sensitive regulator of adipocyte differentiation and function.},

We here assessed its biological significance in NED, and metastatic potential of PCa.SNAI2 expression was down-regulated in most PCa epithelia, in association with gene promoter methylation, except for cell clusters forming: a. the expansion/invasion front of high-grade PCa, b. NED areas, or c. lymph node metastasis.Knockdown of SNAI2 in PC3 cells down-regulated the expression of neural-tissue-associated adhesion molecules, Neural-Cadherin, Neural-Cadherin-2, Neuronal-Cell-Adhesion-Molecule, and of the NED marker Neuron-Specific Enolase, whereas it abolished Chromogranin-A expression. The metastasis-suppressor genes, Nm23-H1 and KISS1, were up-regulated, while the pluripotency genes SOX2, NOTCH1, CD44v6, WWTR1/TAZ and YAP1 were dramatically down-regulated. Over-expression of SNAI2 in DU145 cells substantiated its ability to regulate metastasis-suppressor, NED and pluripotency genes. In PCa and lymph node metastasis, expression of SOX2 and NOTCH1 was highly related to that of SNAI2.In conclusion, I. SNAI2 silencing in PCa may turn-off the expression of NED markers and pluripotency genes, while turning-on that of specific metastasis-suppressors, II. SNAI2 expression in selected PCa cells, by regulating their self-renewal, NED and metastatic potential, endows them with highly malignant properties. SNAI2 may thus constitute a key target for modern approaches to PCa progression.},

abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is a conserved signal transduction pathway found in organisms of complexity spanning from yeast to humans. In many mammalian tissue types, this pathway can correctly transduce signals from different extracellular messengers, leading to specific and often mutually exclusive cellular responses. The transduced signal is tuned by a complicated set of positive and negative feedback control mechanisms and fed into a downstream gene expression network. This network, based on the immediate early gene system, has two possible, mutually exclusive outcomes. Using a mathematical model, we study how different stimuli lead to different temporal signal structure. Further, we investigate how each of the feedback controls contributes to the overall specificity of the gene expression output, and hypothesize that the complicated nature of the mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway results in a system able to robustly identify and transduce the proper signal without investing in two completely separate signal cascades. Finally, we quantify the role of the RKIP protein in shaping the signal, and propose a novel mechanism of its involvement in cancer metastasis. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {RNase L is a regulated endoribonuclease that functions in the interferon antiviral response. Activation of RNase L by 2', 5'-oligoadenylates has been linked to apoptosis, autophagy and inflammation. Genetic studies have also suggested the possible involvement of the RNase L gene (RNASEL) on chromosome 1q25.3 in several types of cancer. Here we report that ablation of RNase L in human prostate cancer PC3 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology enhanced cell migration as determined both by transwell assays and scratch wound healing assays. In addition, RNase L knockdown by means of RNAi increased migration of PC3 and DU145 cells in response to either fibronectin or serum stimulation, as did homozygous disruption of the RNase L gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Serum or fibronectin stimulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) autophosphorylation on tyrosine-397 was increased by either knockdown or ablation of RNase L. In contrast, a missense mutant RNase L (R667A) lacking catalytic activity failed to suppress cell migration in PC3 cells. However, a nuclease-inactive mutant mouse RNase L (W630A) was able to partially inhibit migration of mouse fibroblasts. Consistent with a role for the catalytic activity of RNase L, transfection of PC3 cells with the RNase L activator, 2', 5'-oligoadenylate, suppressed cell migration. RNase L knockdown in PC3 cells enhanced tumor growth and metastasis following implantation in the mouse prostate. Our results suggest that naturally occurring mutations in the RNase L gene might promote enhanced cell migration and metastasis.},

abstract = {A large number of cellular signaling processes are directed through internalization, via endocytosis, of polyubiquitinated cargo proteins. Tollip is an adaptor protein that facilitates endosomal cargo sorting for lysosomal degradation. Tollip preferentially binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) via its C2 domain, an association that may be required for endosomal membrane targeting. Here, we show that Tollip binds ubiquitin through its C2 and CUE domains and that its association with the C2 domain inhibits PtdIns(3)P binding. NMR analysis demonstrates that the C2 and CUE domains bind to overlapping sites on ubiquitin, suggesting that two ubiquitin molecules associate with Tollip simultaneously. Hydrodynamic studies reveal that ubiquitin forms heterodimers with the CUE domain, indicating that the association disrupts the dimeric state of the CUE domain. We propose that, in the absence of polyubiquitinated cargo, the dual binding of ubiquitin partitions Tollip into membrane-bound and membrane-free states, a function that contributes to the engagement of Tollip in both membrane trafficking and cytosolic pathways.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a cellular catabolic process that relies on the cooperation of autophagosomes and lysosomes. During starvation, the cell expands both compartments to enhance degradation processes. We found that starvation activates a transcriptional program that controls major steps of the autophagic pathway, including autophagosome formation, autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and substrate degradation. The transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master gene for lysosomal biogenesis, coordinated this program by driving expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes. Nuclear localization and activity of TFEB were regulated by serine phosphorylation mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, whose activity was tuned by the levels of extracellular nutrients. Thus, a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism regulates autophagy by controlling the biogenesis and partnership of two distinct cellular organelles.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for `soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion).We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the `weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its `unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding.We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study, we investigated the activation of transforming growth factor- receptor-1 [TGF- R1; i.e., activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) receptor] and TGF-/Smad signaling pathway in CNT-induced collagen production in human lung fibroblasts. Human lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells were exposed to low, physiologically relevant concentrations (0.02– 0.6 g/cm2) of single-walled CNTs (SWCNT) and multiwalled CNTs (MWCNT) in culture and analyzed for collagen, TGF-1, TGF- R1, and SMAD proteins by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Chemical inhibition of ALK5 and shorthairpin (sh) RNA targeting of TGF- R1 and Smad2 were used to probe the fibrogenic mechanism of CNTs. Both SWCNT and MWCNT induced an overexpression of TGF-1, TGF- R1 and Smad2/3 proteins in lung fibroblasts compared with vehicle or ultrafine carbon black-exposed controls. SWCNT- and MWCNT-induced collagen production was blocked by ALK5 inhibitor or shRNA knockdown of TGF- R1 and Smad2. Our results indicate the critical role of TGF- R1/Smad2/3 signaling in CNT-induced fibrogenesis by upregulating collagen production in lung fibroblasts.

We report here the characterization of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) as a novel regulator of adipogenesis. XOR lies downstream of C/EBP$\beta$ and upstream of PPAR$\gamma$, in the cascade of factors that control adipogenesis, and it regulates PPAR$\gamma$ activity. In vitro, knockdown of XOR inhibits adipogenesis and PPAR$\gamma$ activity while constitutive overexpression increases activity of the PPAR$\gamma$ receptor in both adipocytes and preadipocytes. In vivo, XOR -/- mice demonstrate 50{\%} reduction in adipose mass versus wild-type littermates while obese ob/ob mice exhibit increased concentrations of XOR mRNA and urate in the adipose tissue. We propose that XOR is a novel regulator of adipogenesis and of PPAR$\gamma$ activity and essential for the regulation of fat accretion.

abstract = {Despite the established oncogenic function of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in human cancers, its role as a tumor suppressor is also evident; however, the mechanism underlying the regulation of the paradoxical functions of PRC2 in tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Here we show that hypoxia-inducible factor 1, $\alpha$-subunit (HIFI-$\alpha$) is a crucial modulator of PRC2 and enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2) function in breast cancer. Interrogating the genomic expression of breast cancer indicates high HIF1A activity correlated with high EZH2 expression but low PRC2 activity in triple-negative breast cancer compared with other cancer subtypes. In the absence of HIFIA activation, PRC2 represses the expression of matrix metalloproteinase genes (MMPs) and invasion, whereas a discrete Ezh2 complexed with Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) acts to promote the expression of MMPs. HIF1-$\alpha$ induction upon hypoxia results in PRC2 inactivation by selective suppression of the expression of suppressor of zeste 12 protein homolog (SUZ12) and embryonic ectoderm development (EED), leading to a functional switch toward Ezh2/FoxM1-dependent induction of the expression of MMPs and invasion. Our study suggests a tumor-suppressive function of PRC2, which is restricted by HIF1-$\alpha$, and an oncogenic function of Ezh2, which cooperates with FoxM1 to promote invasion in triple-negative breast cancer.},

abstract = {In addition to genetic alterations, cancer cells are characterized by myriad epigenetic changes. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that is over-expressed and mutated in cancer. The EZH2 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations first identified in lymphomas have recently been reported in melanoma ({\~{}}2{\%}) but remain uncharacterized. We expressed multiple EZH2 GOF mutations in the A375 metastatic skin melanoma cell line and observed both increased H3K27me3 and dramatic changes in 3D culture morphology. In these cells, prominent morphological changes were accompanied by a decrease in cell contractility and an increase in collective cell migration. At the molecular level, we observed significant alteration of the axonal guidance pathway, a pathway intricately involved in the regulation of cell shape and motility. Furthermore, the aggressive 3D morphology of EZH2 GOF-expressing melanoma cells (both endogenous and ectopic) was attenuated by EZH2 catalytic inhibition. Finally, A375 cells expressing exogenous EZH2 GOF mutants formed larger tumors than control cells in mouse xenograft studies. This study not only demonstrates the first functional characterization of EZH2 GOF mutants in non-hematopoietic cells, but also provides a rationale for EZH2 catalytic inhibition in melanoma.},

abstract = {The origin of large but rare cascades that are triggered by small initial shocks  is a phenomenon that manifests itself as diversely as cultural fads, collective action, the diffusion of norms and innovations, and cascading failures in infrastructure and organizational networks. This paper presents a possible explanation of this phenomenon in terms of a sparse, random network of interacting agents whose decisions are determined by the actions of their neighbors according to a simple threshold rule. Two regimes are identified in which the network is susceptible to very large cascades-herein called global cascades-that occur very rarely. When cascade propagation is limited by the connectivity of the network, a power law distribution of cascade sizes is observed, analogous to the cluster size distribution in standard percolation theory and avalanches in self-organized criticality. But when the network is highly connected, cascade propagation is limited instead by the local stability of the nodes themselves, and the size distribution of cascades is bimodal, implying a more extreme kind of instability that is correspondingly harder to anticipate. In the first regime, where the distribution of network neighbors is highly skewed, it is found that the most connected nodes are far more likely than average nodes to trigger cascades, but not in the second regime. Finally, it is shown that heterogeneity plays an ambiguous role in determining a system's stability: increasingly heterogeneous thresholds make the system more vulnerable to global cascades; but an increasingly heterogeneous degree distribution makes it less vulnerable.},

abstract = {The CT/GC-rich region (-76 to -47) is one transcriptional regulatory region of the interleukin-3 (IL-3) gene which confers basic transcriptional activity and responds to trans-activation by human T-cell leukemia virus type I-encoded Tax. We isolated three types of cDNAs encoding Cys2/His2-type zinc finger proteins that bind to this region. Two were identical to known transcription factors, EGR1 and EGR2, and the other clone, named DB1, encoded a novel protein of 516 amino acids with six zinc finger motifs. DB1 mRNA was present in human tissues, ubiquitously. Two constitutive transcripts of 4.0 and 4.8 kb in length were present in Jurkat cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, with specific antibodies, showed that DB1 constitutively binds to this region whereas EGR1 binds in a T-cell activation-dependent manner. Overexpression of DB1 in Jurkat cells had no detectable effect on the transcription activity of the IL-3 promoter, in a transient-transfection assay. EGR1 and EGR2 increased IL-3 promoter activity when the transfected cells were stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and A23187. When DB1 was cotransfected with a Tax expression vector, transcription activity of the IL-3 promoter induced by Tax was significantly increased, while EGR1 and EGR2 were without effect. These results suggest that EGR1 has a role in inducible transcription of the IL-3 gene, while DB1 sustains basal transcriptional activity and also cooperates with Tax to activate the IL-3 promoter.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological significance and biological roles of WWC3 in human gastric cancer (GC). Clinical significance of WWC3 in human GCs was examined by using immunohistochemistry (IHC). WWC3 was downregulated in 48 of 111 human GCs, and its downregulation was associated with advanced stage, positive nodal status, and higher relapse rate. Importantly, WWC3 downregulation correlated with poor survival. It was also found that WWC3 protein expression was downregulated in GC cell lines compared with normal cell line GES-1. On one hand, WWC3 overexpression inhibited the cell growth rate and invading ability in HGC-27 cell line. On the other hand, depleting WWC3 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted proliferation rate and invading ability in the SGC-7901 cell line. In addition, cell cycle analysis showed that WWC3 overexpression inhibited while its depletion accelerated cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition. Western blot (WB) analysis demonstrated that WWC3 repressed cyclin D1 and cyclin E while upregulated p27 expression. Luciferase reporter assay showed that WWC3 activated Hippo signaling pathway by suppressing TEAD transcription activity, with downregulation of total and nuclear YAP and its target CTGF. WWC3 siRNA depletion exhibited the opposite effects. In conclusion, this study indicates that WWC3 serves as a tumor suppressor in GC by activating Hippo signaling.},

abstract = {The relative balance between the quantity of white and brown adipose tissue can profoundly affect lipid stor- age and whole-body energy homeostasis. However, the mechanisms regulating the formation, expansion, and interconversion of these 2 distinct types of fat remain unknown. Recently, the lysosomal degradative pathway of macroautophagy has been identified as a regulator of cellular differentiation, suggesting that autophagy may modulate this process in adipocytes. The function of autophagy in adipose differentiation was therefore examined in the current study by genetic inhibition of the critical macroautophagy gene autophagy-related 7 (Atg7). Knockdown of Atg7 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes inhibited lipid accumulation and decreased protein lev- els of adipocyte differentiation factors. Knockdown of Atg5 or pharmacological inhibition of autophagy or lysosome function also had similar effects. An adipocyte-specific mouse knockout of Atg7 generated lean mice with decreased white adipose mass and enhanced insulin sensitivity. White adipose tissue in knockout mice had increased features of brown adipocytes, which, along with an increase in normal brown adipose tissue, led to an elevated rate of fatty acid, $\beta$-oxidation, and a lean body mass. Autophagy therefore functions to regulate body lipid accumulation by controlling adipocyte differentiation and determining the balance between white and brown fat. Introduction},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\delta$ (PPAR$\delta$) play central roles in regulating metabolism in adipose tissue, as well as being targets for the treatment of insulin resistance. While the role of PPAR$\gamma$ in regulating insulin sensitivity has been well defined, research into PPAR$\delta$ has been limited until recently due to a scarcity of selective PPAR$\delta$ agonists. RESULTS The metabolic effects of PPAR$\gamma$ and PPAR$\delta$ activation have been examined in vivo in white adipose tissue from ob/ob mice and in vitro in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes using (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry metabolomics to understand the receptors' contrasting roles. These steady state measurements were supplemented with (13)C-stable isotope substrate labeling to assess fluxes, in addition to respirometry and transcriptomic microarray analysis. The metabolic effects of the receptors were readily distinguished, with PPAR$\gamma$ activation characterized by increased fat storage, synthesis and elongation, while PPAR$\delta$ activation caused increased fatty acid $\beta$-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle rate and oxidation of extracellular branch chain amino acids. Stimulated glycolysis and increased fatty acid desaturation were common pathways for the agonists. CONCLUSIONS PPAR$\gamma$ and PPAR$\delta$ restore insulin sensitivity through varying mechanisms. PPAR$\delta$ activation increases total oxidative metabolism in white adipose tissue, a tissue not traditionally thought of as oxidative. However, the increased metabolism of branch chain amino acids may provide a mechanism for muscle atrophy, which has been linked to activation of this nuclear receptor. PPAR$\delta$ has a role as an anti-obesity target and as an anti-diabetic, and hence may target both the cause and consequences of dyslipidemia.},

abstract = {Escape from cellular senescence induction is a potent mechanism for chemoresistance. Cellular senescence can be induced in breast cancer cell lines by the removal of estrogen signaling with tamoxifen or by the accumulation of DNA damage induced by the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Long term culturing of the hormone-sensitive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in doxorubicin (MCF-7/DoxR) reduced the ability of doxorubicin, but not tamoxifen, to induce senescence. Two pathways that are often upregulated in chemo- and hormonal-resistance are the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. To determine if active Akt-1 and Raf-1 can influence drug-induced senescence, we stably introduced activated $\Delta$Akt-1(CA) and $\Delta$Raf-1(CA) into drug-sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant cells. Expression of a constitutively-active Raf-1 construct resulted in higher baseline senescence, indicating these cells possessed the ability to undergo oncogene-induced-senescence. Constitutive activation of the Akt pathway significantly decreased drug-induced senescence in response to doxorubicin but not tamoxifen in MCF-7 cells. However, constitutive Akt-1 activation in drug-resistant cells containing high levels of active ERK completely escaped cellular senescence induced by doxorubicin and tamoxifen. These results indicate that up regulation of the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway in the presence of elevated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling together can contribute to drug-resistance by diminishing cell senescence in response to chemotherapy. Understanding how breast cancers containing certain oncogenic mutations escape cell senescence in response to chemotherapy and hormonal based therapies may provide insights into the design of more effective drug combinations for the treatment of breast cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Co-expression measures are often used to define networks among genes. Mutual information (MI) is often used as a generalized correlation measure. It is not clear how much MI adds beyond standard (robust) correlation measures or regression model based association measures. Further, it is important to assess what transformations of these and other co-expression measures lead to biologically meaningful modules (clusters of genes). RESULTS We provide a comprehensive comparison between mutual information and several correlation measures in 8 empirical data sets and in simulations. We also study different approaches for transforming an adjacency matrix, e.g. using the topological overlap measure. Overall, we confirm close relationships between MI and correlation in all data sets which reflects the fact that most gene pairs satisfy linear or monotonic relationships. We discuss rare situations when the two measures disagree. We also compare correlation and MI based approaches when it comes to defining co-expression network modules. We show that a robust measure of correlation (the biweight midcorrelation transformed via the topological overlap transformation) leads to modules that are superior to MI based modules and maximal information coefficient (MIC) based modules in terms of gene ontology enrichment. We present a function that relates correlation to mutual information which can be used to approximate the mutual information from the corresponding correlation coefficient. We propose the use of polynomial or spline regression models as an alternative to MI for capturing non-linear relationships between quantitative variables. CONCLUSION The biweight midcorrelation outperforms MI in terms of elucidating gene pairwise relationships. Coupled with the topological overlap matrix transformation, it often leads to more significantly enriched co-expression modules. Spline and polynomial networks form attractive alternatives to MI in case of non-linear relationships. Our results indicate that MI networks can safely be replaced by correlation networks when it comes to measuring co-expression relationships in stationary data.},

We previously showed a secreted, dominant-negative LRP5 receptor (DNLRP5) suppressed in vitro migration and invasion of the OS cell line SaOS-2. Therefore, we hypothesized DNLRP5 also has in vivo antitumor activity against OS. We used the 143B cell line as a model to study the effect of DNLRP5 by stable transfection. Inhibition of Wnt signaling by DNLRP5 was verified by a reduction in TOPFLASH luciferase activity. In soft agar, DNLRP5-transfected 143B cells formed fewer and smaller colonies than control transfected cells. DNLRP5 transfection reduced in vivo tumor growth of 143B cells in nude mice. DNLRP5 also decreased in vitro cellular motility in a scratch wound assay. In a spontaneous pulmonary metastasis model, DNLRP5 reduced both the size and number of lung metastatic nodules. The reduction in cellular invasiveness by DNLRP5 was associated with decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, N-cadherin, and Snail. Our data suggest canonical Wnt/LRP5 signaling reflects an important underlying mechanism of OS progression. Therefore, strategies to suppress LRP5-mediated signaling in OS cells may lead to a reduction in local or systemic disease burden.},

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) inhibitors are successful drugs for a large variety of tumors, yet its efficacy in cervical cancer is unclear. The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of alterations on HER family receptors in cervical cancer patients and to assess the effect of its pharmacological inhibition. Methods: We characterized the expression of HER family by immunohistochemistry in a series of 231 tumors. The results were further validated by in silico analysis. The anti-tumorigenic effect of different pan-RTK inhibitors was evaluated in different in vitro models and in vivo approaches. Results: HER2 was overexpressed and associated with patients' poor prognosis, as corroborated by in silico analysis. Also a good correlation was observed between HER2 amplification and its mRNA and protein overexpression. By in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that HER receptors are specific targetable proteins to fighting cervical cancer cellular aggressiveness, mainly with lapatinib and allitinib pan-HER inhibitors. Moreover, we anticipated that a bypass in cellular metabolism could underlie drug resistance, mainly to lapatinib, which can be reverted by combination with glucose uptake inhibitors. Conclusions: This is first comparative study of HER family receptors expression in a large series of cervical carcinomas, and we found HER2 expression as an independent prognostic marker for this patients. We also demonstrated for the first time that HER targeted therapies alone or in combination with glucose metabolism inhibitors, are effective in the blockage of cervical cancer cells aggressiveness.},

Although aging is almost universally conserved among all organisms, the underlying molecular mechanisms of aging remain largely elusive. Many theories of aging have been proposed, including the free-radical and mitochondrial theories of aging. Both theories speculate that cumulative damage to mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the causes of aging. Oxidative damage affects replication and transcription of mtDNA and results in a decline in mitochondrial function which in turn leads to enhanced ROS production and further damage to mtDNA. In this paper, we will present the current understanding of the interplay between ROS and mitochondria and will discuss their potential impact on aging and age-related diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Mammalian white adipocytes have a unique structure in which nearly the entire cell volume is occupied by a single large lipid droplet, while the surrounding cytoplasm occupies minimal space. The massive cytoplasmic remodeling processes involved in the formation of this unique cellular structure are poorly defined. Autophagy is a membrane trafficking process leading to lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic components. Here, we investigated the functional role of atg5, a gene encoding an essential protein required for autophagy, in adipocyte differentiation in a cellular model and in mice. Massive autophagy was activated when wild-type primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were induced for adipocyte differentiation. Importantly, the autophagy deficient primary atg5(-/-) MEFs exhibited dramatically reduced efficiency in adipogenesis. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that atg5(-/-) MEFs initially appeared to differentiate normally; however, a majority of the differentiating atg5(-/-) cells ultimately failed to undergo further morphological transformation and eventually died, likely through apoptosis. Consistent with these in vitro results, histological analysis revealed that the atg5(-/-) late-stage embryos and neonatal pups had much less subcutaneous perilipin A-positive adipocytes. Consistently, when treated with chloroquine, a functional inhibitor of autophagy, wild-type MEFs exhibited drastically reduced efficiency of adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that Atg5 is involved in normal adipocyte differentiation, suggesting an important role of autophagy in adipogenesis.},

abstract = {This book addresses the therapeutic strategies to target mitochondrial metabolism in diseases where the function of that organelle is compromised, and it discusses the effective strategies used to create mitochondrial-targeted agents that can become commercially available drug delivery platforms. The consistent growth of research focused in understanding the multifaceted role of mitochondria in cellular metabolism, controlling pathways related with cell death, and ionic/redox regulation has extended the research of mitochondrial chemical-biological interactions to include various pharmacological and toxicological applications. Not only does the book extensively cover basic mitochondrial physiology, but it also links the molecular interactions within these pathways to a variety of diseases. It is one of the first books to combine state-of-the-art reviews regarding basic mitochondrial biology, the role of mitochondrial alterations in different diseases, and the importance of that organelle as a target for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to improve human health.

abstract = {Breast cancer progression is driven by altered gene expression. We show that the RIN1 gene, which encodes a RAS effector regulating epithelial cell properties, is silenced in breast tumor cell lines compared with cultured human mammary epithelial cells. We also report that RIN1 is often reduced in human breast tumor cells compared with morphologically normal breast glandular cells. At least two silencing mechanisms seem to be involved. Overexpression of the transcription repressor SNAI1 (Snail) was observed in ZR75-1 cells, and SNAI1 knockdown restored RIN1 expression. In addition, DNA methylation within the RIN1 promoter and the first exon in KPL-1 cells suggested that epigenetic modifications may contribute to silencing, and demethylation was shown to restore RIN1 expression. Reexpression of RIN1 was shown to inhibit anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. In addition, RIN1 expression inhibited both the initiation and progression of tumorigenesis for two breast tumor cell lines in a mouse model, consistent with a tumor suppressor function. We also show that RIN1 acts as a negative regulator of tumor cell invasive growth and that this requires the ABL kinase-signaling function of RIN1, suggesting a mechanism through which RIN1 silencing may contribute to breast cancer progression.},

Acquired resistance to PI3K-mTOR inhibition is a major hurdle to overcome in the success of PI3K-mTOR targeted agents. H460, A549, and H1975 resistant cells were generated by prolonged treatment in culture with Apitolisib (GDC-0980), a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor over a period of several months, from age-matched parent cells. Resistance was deemed to have developed when a log fold difference in IC50 had been achieved. Resistant cell lines also exhibited resistance to another widely investigated PI3K-mTOR dual inhibitor; Dactolisib (BEZ235). Cell lines were characterised at the level of mRNA (expression array profiling expression of {\textgreater}150 genes), miRNA (expression array profiling of 2100 miRNAs), protein (bottoms-up label-free mass spectrometry) and phosphoprotein (expression array profiling of 84 phospho/total proteins). Key alterations were validated by qPCR and Western blot. H1975 cells were initially most sensitive to Apitolisib (GDC-0980), but developed resistance more quickly than the other cell lines, perhaps due to increased selective pressure from the impressive initial effect. In-depth molecular profiling suggested epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may play a role in resistance to PI3K-mTOR dual inhibition in NSCLC.},

abstract = {The transcription factor YY1 is a complex protein that is involved in repressing and activating a diverse number of promoters. Numerous studies have attempted to understand how this one factor can act both as a repressor and an activator in such a wide set of different contexts. The fact that YY1 interacts with a number of key regulatory proteins (e.g. TBP, TFIIB, TAFII55, Sp1, and E1A) has suggested that these interactions are important for determining which particular function of YY1 is displayed at a specific promoter. Two groups of proteins, previously known to function as corepressors and coactivators, that now seem likely to modulate YY1's functions, are the histone deacetylases (HDAC) and histone acetyltransferases (HAT). These two groups of enzymes modify histones, and this modification is proposed to alter chromatin structure. Acetylated histones are typically localized to active chromatin while deacetylated histones colocalize with transcriptionally inactive chromatin. When these enzymes are directed to a promoter through a DNA binding factor such as YY1, that promoter can be activated or repressed. This review will discuss the recent work dealing with the different proteins that interact with YY1, with particular emphasis on ones that modify chromatin, and how they could be involved in regulating YY1's activities.},

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in generating these autocrine loops are still largely unknown. In the present study, we examine the role of the transcription factor RUNX2 in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expression in melanoma. We have demonstrated that RUNX2-deficient melanoma cells display a significant decrease in three receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR, IGF-1R and PDGFR{\&}beta;. In addition, we found co-expression of RUNX2 and another RTK, AXL, in both melanoma cells and melanoma patient samples. We observed a decrease in phosphoAKT2 (S474) and phosphoAKT (T308) levels when RUNX2 knock down resulted in significant RTK down regulation. Finally, we showed a dramatic up regulation of RUNX2 expression with concomitant up-regulation of EGFR, IGF-1R and AXL in melanoma cells resistant to the BRAF V600E inhibitor PLX4720. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that RUNX2 might be a key player in RTK-based autocrine loops and a mediator of resistance to BRAF V600E inhibitors involving RTK up regulation in melanoma.},

abstract = {Inappropriate activation of PI3K signaling has been implicated strongly in human cancer. Although studies on the role of PI3K signaling in breast tumorigenesis and progression have focused most intensively on PI3K$\alpha$, a role for PI3K$\beta$ has begun to emerge. The PI3K$\beta$ isoform is unique among class IA PI3K enzymes in that it is activated by both receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). In previous work, we identified a mutation that specifically abolishes PI3K$\beta$ binding to G$\beta$$\gamma$ (p110(526KK-DD)). Expression of this mutant in p110$\beta$-silenced breast cancer cells inhibits multiple steps of the metastatic cascade in vitro and in vivo and causes a cell autonomous defect in invadopodial matrix degradation. Our results identify a novel link between GPCRs and PI3K$\beta$ in mediating metastasis, suggesting that disruption of this link might offer a novel therapeutic target to prevent the development of metastatic disease.

abstract = {The ability to modify the transcriptional program in response to external signals provides a way for mammalian cells to alter their biological fate and properties, thereby adapting to changes in the environment. Adipocytes are excellent examples of differentiated cells that possess a striking transcriptional plasticity when exposed to physiological and metabolic stimuli. In our work, we have focused on understanding the processes responsible for modulating the genomic programming in response to different external signals. Thus, we have shown that browning of human adipocytes with rosiglitazone, an antidiabetic agonist of the key adipocyte transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$), involves redistribution of PPAR$\gamma$ binding to form browning-selective PPAR$\gamma$ super-enhancers that drive expression of key browning genes. These include genes encoding transcriptional regulators, such as Kr{\"{u}}ppel-like factor 11 (KLF11) that are essential for modulating the genomic program in white adipocytes to induce browning. Furthermore, we have shown that acute suppression of adipocyte genes by the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), involves redistribution of cofactors to enhancers activated by the master inflammatory regulator, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-$\kappa$B). Interestingly, this redistribution occurs selectively from enhancers with high-cofactor occupancies, thereby predominantly affecting super-enhancers and their associated genes. We propose that this is a general mechanism contributing to transcriptional repression associated with activation of signal-dependent transcription factors.},

However, the exact contribution of various allelic alterations remains unclear. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of the transforming growth factor $\beta$ receptor I 6A/9A (T$\beta$R-I 6A/9A) gene polymorphism with breast cancer risk. Relevant studies were identified from PubMed and Cochrane Library on 1 October 2013, and eligible reports were recruited and synthesized. Eleven reports that included a total of 12 studies were recruited into this meta-analysis for the association of the T$\beta$R-I 6A/9A gene polymorphism and breast cancer risk. The results indicated that overall the T$\beta$R-I 6A allele was associated with breast cancer risk (OR = 1.33, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-1.73, p = 0.04). However, the T$\beta$R-I 6A/6A and 9A/9A genotypes were not associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer (6A/6A: OR = 1.71, 95{\%} CI: 0.95-3.08, p = 0.07; 9A/9A: OR = 0.82, 95{\%} CI: 0.66-1.02, p = 0.08). In the Caucasian population, no such association could be established. In conclusion, the T$\beta$R-I 6A allele might represent a risk factor for breast cancer risk, but significantly larger data sets from a larger number of studies, including studies that allow ethnicity, subgroup analysis and environmental impact evaluation, are required to maximize statistical significance and meta-analysis robustness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Dose-related toxicity is the major restriction of cisplatin and cisplatin-combination chemotherapy, and is a challenge for advanced gastric cancer treatment. We explored the possibility of using Paris saponin I as an agent to sensitize gastric cancer cells to cisplatin, and examined the underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Growth inhibition was detected by MTT assay. The cell cycle and apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry and Annexin V/PI staining. The P21waf1/cip1, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 protein expression were detected using Western blot analysis. RESULTS The results revealed that PSI sensitized gastric cancer cells to cisplatin, with low toxicity. The IC50 value of cisplatin in SGC-7901 cell lines was decreased when combined with PSI. PSI promoted cisplatin-induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in a cisplatin concentration-dependent manner. Bcl-2 protein expression decreased, but Bax, caspase-3, and P21waf1/cip1 protein expression increased with PSI treatment. CONCLUSIONS The underlying mechanism of Paris saponin I may be related to targeting the apoptosis pathway and cell cycle blocking, which suggests that PSI is a potential therapeutic sensitizer for cisplatin in treating gastric cancer.},

abstract = {The prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e., TF regulon) is becoming a widely used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and data sets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are (1) manually curated repositories, (2) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (3) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (4) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression data sets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations and, thereby, downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark data sets. We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions for 1541 human TFs and evaluated how different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities, or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies, with confidence scores, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.},

Here, we identify a mechanism that regulates adiposity based on the activator of autophagy TP53INP2. We report that TP53INP2 is a negative regulator of adipogenesis in human and mouse preadipocytes. In keeping with this, TP53INP2 ablation in mice caused enhanced adiposity, which was characterized by greater cellularity of subcutaneous adipose tissue and increased expression of master adipogenic genes. TP53INP2 modulates adipogenesis through autophagy-dependent sequestration of GSK3$\beta$ into late endosomes. GSK3$\beta$ sequestration was also dependent on ESCRT activity. As a result, TP53INP2 promotes greater $\beta$-catenin levels and induces the transcriptional activity of TCF/LEF transcription factors. These results demonstrate a link between autophagy, sequestration of GSK3$\beta$ into late endosomes and inhibition of adipogenesis in vivo.},

abstract = {Malignant glioma cells invade the surrounding brain parenchyma, by migrating along the blood vessels, thus promoting cancer growth. The biological bases of these activities are grounded in profound alterations of the metabolism and the structural organization of the cells, which consequently acquire the ability to modify the surrounding microenvironment, by altering the extracellular matrix and affecting the properties of the other cells present in the brain, such as normal glial-, endothelial- and immune-cells. Most of the effects on the surrounding environment are probably exerted through the release of a variety of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which contain many different classes of molecules, from genetic material to defined species of lipids and enzymes. EV-associated molecules can be either released into the extracellular matrix (ECM) and/or transferred to neighboring cells: as a consequence, both deep modifications of the recipient cell phenotype and digestion of ECM components are obtained, thus causing cancer propagation, as well as a general brain dysfunction. In this review, we first analyze the main intracellular and extracellular transformations required for glioma cell invasion into the brain parenchyma; then we discuss how these events may be attributed, at least in part, to EVs that, like the pawns of a dramatic chess game with cancer, open the way to the tumor cells themselves.},

abstract = {Background: One of the major challenges in traditional mathematical modeling of gene regulatory circuits is the insufficient knowledge of kinetic parameters. These parameters are often inferred from existing experimental data and/or educated guesses, which can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for large networks. Results: We present a user-friendly computational tool for the community to use our newly developed method named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE), to explore the robust dynamical features of gene regulatory circuits without the requirement of detailed kinetic parameters. Taking the network topology as the only input, RACIPE generates an ensemble of circuit models with distinct randomized parameters and uniquely identifies robust dynamical properties by statistical analysis. Here, we discuss the implementation of the software and the statistical analysis methods of RACIPE-generated data to identify robust gene expression patterns and the functions of genes and regulatory links. Finally, we apply the tool on coupled toggle-switch circuits and a published circuit of B-lymphopoiesis. Conclusions: We expect our new computational tool to contribute to a more comprehensive and unbiased understanding of mechanisms underlying gene regulatory networks.

Recurrent somatic base-pair substitutions are believed to be less contributory in prostate tumorigenesis but have not been systematically analyzed in large cohorts. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 112 prostate tumor and normal tissue pairs. New recurrent mutations were identified in multiple genes, including MED12 and FOXA1. SPOP was the most frequently mutated gene, with mutations involving the SPOP substrate-binding cleft in 6-15{\%} of tumors across multiple independent cohorts. Prostate cancers with mutant SPOP lacked ETS family gene rearrangements and showed a distinct pattern of genomic alterations.

abstract = {Skeletal metastases are complications of epithelial cancers, among which breast, prostate and lung carcinomas are the most osteotropic. In primary tumours, a subset of cancer cells undergoes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, acquires mobility to migrate into the surrounding stroma and seeds at distant sites to grow. The specific development of bone metastasis requires the recruitment of circulating tumour cells in the bone marrow, their adaptation to survive in the surrounding microenvironment where they alter the functions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and hijack signals coming from the bone matrix. Each of the molecular pathways underlining these steps is regulated by multiple factors, through the tight control of genes expressed by cancer cells interacting with cells from the bone microenvironment. In this context, miRNAs can act as master regulators of gene expression to control multiple aspects of bone metastasis formation, including cancer cell escape from the primary tumour site, cancer cell dissemination to bone and invasion of the bone marrow, as well as secondary outgrowth and tumour-stroma cell interactions. In the clinic, specific miRNA signatures have been identified in osteotropic cancer cells, raising the possibility that miRNAs could be used as biomarkers of bone metastasis. The regulatory activity of miRNAs in the bone microenvironment also suggests that miRNAs could be promising therapeutic targets.},

NPC is a unique malignant epithelial carcinoma of head and neck region, with an intimate association with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Currently, the prediction of NPC prognosis is mainly based on the clinical TNM staging; however, NPC patients with the same clinical stage often present different clinical outcomes, suggesting that the TNM stage is insufficient to precisely predict the prognosis of this disease. In this review, we give an overview of the prognostic value of molecular markers in NPC and discuss potential strategies of targeted therapies for treatment of NPC. Molecular biomarkers, which play roles in abnormal proliferation signaling pathways (such as Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway), intracellular mitogenic signal aberration (such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a), receptor-mediated aberrations (such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), tumor suppressors (such as p16 and p27 activity), cell cycle aberrations (such as cyclin D1 and cyclin E), cell adhesion aberrations (such as E-cadherin), apoptosis dysregualtion (such as survivin) and centromere aberration (centromere protein H), are prognostic markers for NPC. Plasma EBV DNA concentrations and EBV-encoded latent membrane proteins are also prognostic markers for NPC. Implication of molecular targeted therapies in NPC was discussed. Such therapies could have potential in combination with different cytotoxic agents to combat and eradicate tumor cells. In order to further improve overall survival for patients with loco-regionally advanced NPC, the development of innovative strategies, including prognostic molecular markers and molecular targeted agents is needed.},

abstract = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) coordinates cellular growth and metabolism with environmental inputs to ensure that cells grow only under favourable conditions. When active, mTORC1 stimulates biosynthetic pathways including protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis and inhibits cellular catabolism through repression of the autophagic pathway, thereby promoting cell growth and proliferation. The recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface has been shown to be essential for its activation. This finding has significantly enhanced our knowledge of mTORC1 regulation and has focused the attention of the field on the lysosome as a signalling hub which coordinates several homeostatic pathways. The intriguing localisation of mTORC1 to the cellular organelle that plays a crucial role in catabolism enables mTORC1 to feedback to autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, thus leading mTORC1 to enact precise spatial and temporal control of cell growth. This review will cover the signalling interactions which take place on the surface of lysosomes and the cross-talk which exists between mTORC1 activity and lysosomal function.},

High expression of TRAIL-R2 was found to be associated with poor prognostic parameters in breast cancer patients, suggesting an oncogenic function of this receptor. In the present study, we aimed to determine the impact of TRAIL-R2 on breast cancer metastasis. Using an osteotropic variant of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, we examine the effects of TRAIL-R2 knockdown in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, in addition to the reduced levels of the proliferation-promoting factor HMGA2 and corresponding inhibition of cell proliferation, knockdown of TRAIL-R2 increased the levels of E-Cadherin and decreased migration. In vivo, these cells were strongly impaired in their ability to form bone metastases after intracardiac injection. Evaluating possible underlying mechanisms revealed a strong downregulation of CXCR4, the receptor for the chemokine SDF-1 important for homing of cancers cells to the bone. In accordance, cell migration towards SDF-1 was significantly impaired by TRAIL-R2 knockdown. Conversely, overexpression of TRAIL-R2 upregulated CXCR4 levels and enhanced SDF-1-directed migration. We therefore postulate that inhibition of TRAIL-R2 expression could represent a promising therapeutic strategy leading to an effective impairment of breast cancer cell capability to form skeletal metastases.},

The interaction of tumor cells with their microenvironment is essential for tumorigenesis, tumor progression, growth, and metastasis, and resistance to drug therapy. Protein arrays enable the parallel detection of hundreds of proteins in a small amount of biological sample. Recent data have demonstrated that the application of protein arrays may yield valuable information regarding the structure and functional mechanisms of the TME. In this review, we will discuss protein array technologies and their applications in TME analysis to discern pathways involved in promoting the tumorigenic phenotype.},

abstract = {The PIK3C3 gene has been implicated as a candidate gene for schizophrenia by functional evidence and genetic association studies. A series of previous studies have found susceptibility SNPs in promoter region. To further verify its susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Chinese population and the function of the polymorphisms, we performed a case control study in 556 unrelated schizophrenia patients and 563 normal controls as well as an in vitro functional analysis. In our association analysis of-432C-/T, we discovered obvious differences in allele frequency between patients and controls (P = 0.017). A T/C haplotype constructed by -432C-/T and -86insC, which are tightly linked with each other (r2= 1) can significantly weaken promoter's transcriptional activity by 20{\%} (p = 0.002 by t-test). Though we cannot exclude the possibility that susceptibility of -432C-/T is caused by its linkage disequilibrium with other causal variants, our results do support PIK3C3 play a significant role in the etiology of schizophrenia. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Moreover, the SGC has shared about four thousand aliquots of these probes, which have been used primarily for phenotypic profiling or to validate targets in cell lines or primary patient samples cultured in vitro. Epigenetic chemical probes have been critical tools in oncology research and have uncovered mechanistic insights into well-established targets, as well as identify new therapeutic starting points. Indeed, the literature primarily links epigenetic proteins to oncology, but applications in inflammation, viral, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases are now being reported. We summarize the literature of these emerging applications and provide examples where existing probes might be used.},

abstract = {Animals have evolved homeostatic responses to changes in oxygen availability that act on different timescales. Although the hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF) transcriptional pathway that controls long- term responses to low oxygen (hypoxia) has been established1, the pathway that mediates acute responses to hypoxia in mammals is not well understood. Here we show that the olfactory receptor gene Olfr78 is highly and selectively expressed in oxygen-sensitive glomus cells of the carotid body, a chemosensory organ at the carotid artery bifurcation that monitors blood oxygen and stimulates breathing within seconds when oxygen declines2. Olfr78 mutants fail to increase ventilation in hypoxia but respond normally to hypercapnia. Glomus cells are present in normal numbers and appear structurally intact, but hypoxia-induced carotid body activity is diminished. Lactate, a metabolite that rapidly accumulates in hypoxia and induces hyperventilation3–6, activates Olfr78 in heterologous expression experiments, induces calcium transients in glomus cells, and stimulates carotid sinus nerve activity through Olfr78. We propose that, in addition to its role in olfaction, Olfr78 acts as a hypoxia sensor in the breathing circuit by sensing lactate produced when oxygen levels decline.},

abstract = {Low molecular weight and protein sulphydryls undergo reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidation. However, in contrast to the irreversible damages that oxidative conditions yield on biomolecules, the oxidation of reactive cysteines frequently results in reversible modifications, which represent the prototype of the molecular mechanisms underlying redox signaling. Many proteins involved in a wide range of cellular processes have been classified as “redoxsensitive,” thereby modulating their function/activity dependent on the redox state of their critical thiols. Growing evidence from the past few years supports the idea that ROS production also correlates with the occurrence of autophagy. Nonetheless, the cysteine protease Atg4 remains the sole example of a protein whose redox regulation has been completely characterized and demonstrated to be necessary for the progression of autophagy. The principal aim of this commentary is to draw attention to the remarkable number of proteins that can fit the double role of: (i) being involved in autophagy, especially in autophagosome formation and (ii) sensing alterations of the cellular redox state by means of reactive cysteine residues. We will also attempt to provide a hypothetical model to explain the possible functional role of thiols in the occurrence of autophagy and outline a network of redox reactions likely concurring to allow the correct initiation and completion of autophagosomes.},

While most DCEA studies or tools focus on the co-expression relationships among genes, some are developing a potentially more promising research domain, differential regulation analysis (DRA). In our previously proposed R package DCGL v1.0, we provided functions to facilitate basic differential co-expression analyses; however, the output from DCGL v1.0 could not be translated into differential regulation mechanisms in a straightforward manner.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To advance from DCEA to DRA, we upgraded the DCGL package from v1.0 to v2.0. A new module named "Differential Regulation Analysis" (DRA) was designed, which consists of three major functions: DRsort, DRplot, and DRrank. DRsort selects differentially regulated genes (DRGs) and differentially regulated links (DRLs) according to the transcription factor (TF)-to-target information. DRrank prioritizes the TFs in terms of their potential relevance to the phenotype of interest. DRplot graphically visualizes differentially co-expressed links (DCLs) and/or TF-to-target links in a network context. In addition to these new modules, we streamlined the codes from v1.0. The evaluation results proved that our differential regulation analysis is able to capture the regulators relevant to the biological subject.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: With ample functions to facilitate differential regulation analysis, DCGL v2.0 was upgraded from a DCEA tool to a DRA tool, which may unveil the underlying differential regulation from the observed differential co-expression.

Extremely low mutation rate in classical tumor suppressor genes (such as p53 and pRb) and oncogenes (including Ras or myc) indicates that there would be MPM-specific carcinogenesis pathway. To address this, we treated silica to mimic mesothelioma carcinogenesis in mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (NSCLC). Treatment of silica induced p-Erk and Snail through RKIP reduction. In addition, p53 and E-cadherin were decreased by silica-treatment. Elimination of Snail restored p53 expression. We found that NF2 (frequently deleted in MPM) inhibited Snail-mediated p53 suppression and was stabilized by RKIP. Importantly, GN25, an inhibitor of p53-Snail interaction, induced p53 and apoptosis. These results indicate that MPM can be induced by reduction of RKIP/NF2, which suppresses p53 through Snail. Thus, the p53-Snail binding inhibitor such as GN25 is a drug candidate for MPM.},

abstract = {AIMS The role of sonic hedgehog (SHH) in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pancreatic cancer (PC) is known, however, its mechanism is unclear. Because SHH promotes tumor development predominantly through Gli1, we sought to understand its mechanism by identifying Gli1 targets in pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS First, we investigated invasion, migration, and EMT in PC cells transfected with lentiviral Gli1 interference vectors or SHH over-expression vectors in vitro and in vivo. Next, we determined the target gene profiles of Gli1 in PC cells using cDNA microarray assays. Finally, the primary regulatory networks downstream of SHH-Gli1 signaling in PC cells were studied through functional analyses of these targets. RESULTS Our results indicate there is decreased E-cadherin expression upon increased expression of SHH/Gli1. Migration of PC cells increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner within 24 hours of Gli1 expression (P{\textless}0.05). The ratio of liver metastasis and intrasplenic miniature metastasis increased markedly upon activation of SHH-Gli1 signals in nude mice. Using cDNA microarray, we identified 278 upregulated and 59 downregulated genes upon Gli1 expression in AsPC-1 cells. The data indicate that SHH-Gli1 signals promote EMT by mediating a complex signaling network including TGF$\beta$, Ras, Wnt, growth factors, PI3K/AKT, integrins, transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF), and S100A4. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that targeting the molecular connections established between SHH-Gli1 signaling and EMT could provide effective therapies for PC.},

However, whether miR-150 has a critical role in NSCLC cell metastasis is unknown. Here, we reveal that the critical pro-metastatic role of miR-150 in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) through down-regulation of FOXO4 in NSCLC. In vitro, miR-150 targets 3'UTR region of FOXO4 mRNA, thereby negatively regulating its expression. Clinically, the expression of miR-150 was frequently up-regulated in metastatic NSCLC cell lines and clinical specimens. Contrarily, FOXO4 was frequently down-regulated in NSCLC cell lines and clinical specimens. Functional studies show that ectopic expression of miR-150 enhanced tumor cell metastasis in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model, and triggered EMT-like changes in NSCLC cells (including E-cadherin repression, N-cadherin and Vimentin induction, and mesenchymal morphology). Correspondingly, FOXO4 knockdown exhibited pro-metastatic and molecular effects resembling the effect of miR-150 over-expression. Moreover, NF-$\kappa$B/snail/YY1/RKIP circuitry regulated by FOXO4 were likely involved in miR-150-induced EMT event. Simultaneous knockdown of miR-150 and FOXO4 abolished the phenotypic and molecular effects caused by individual knockdown of miR-150. Therefore, our study provides previously unidentified pro-metastatic roles and mechanisms of miR-150 in NSCLC.},

These mRNA targets were enriched in pathways in cancer, Hippo, Wnt, MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways. Co-expression analysis confirmed numerous targets, mRNA genes (RRAS, TGFBR2, NUF2 and PRC1) and lncRNA genes (lncRNA LINC00261, DIO3OS, RP11-307C12.11 and RP11-98D18.9) were potential targets and were significantly correlated with EZH2.

abstract = {The glucose transporter GLUT4 facilitates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in peripheral tissues including adipose, muscle, and heart. GLUT4 function is impaired in obesity and type 2 diabetes leading to hyperglycemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and neuropathy. To understand better the regulation of GLUT4 function, a targeted siRNA screen was performed and led to the discovery that ZFP407 regulates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. The decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake due to ZFP407 deficiency was attributed to a reduction in GLUT4 mRNA and protein levels. The decrease in GLUT4 was due to both decreased transcription of Glut4 mRNA and decreased efficiency of Glut4 pre-mRNA splicing. Interestingly, ZFP407 coordinately regulated this decrease in transcription with an increase in the stability of Glut4 mRNA, resulting in opposing effects on steady-state Glut4 mRNA levels. More broadly, transcriptome analysis revealed that ZFP407 regulates many PPAR$\gamma$ target genes beyond Glut4. ZFP407 was required for the PPAR$\gamma$ agonist Rosiglitazone to increase Glut4 expression, but was not sufficient to increase expression of a PPAR$\gamma$ target gene reporter construct. However, ZFP407 and PPAR$\gamma$ co-overexpression synergistically activated a PPAR$\gamma$ reporter construct beyond the level of PPAR$\gamma$ alone. Thus, ZFP407 may represent a new modulator of the PPAR$\gamma$ signaling pathway.},

A sequence analysis of this novel protein, YY2, revealed an overall 65{\%} identity in the DNA sequence and a 56{\%} identity in protein sequence compared with human YY1. The most pronounced similarity between YY1 and YY2 exists within the zinc finger regions of the two proteins, and consistent with this observation, YY2 can bind to and regulate some promoters known to be controlled by YY1. Similar to YY1, YY2 contains both transcriptional activation and repression functions. The finding of a protein with structure and function similar to YY1 provides a new opportunity to explore additional mechanisms by which YY1-responsive genes can be regulated and suggests that gene regulation by YY1 is far more complicated than previously assumed.},

abstract = {Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and PARK2/Parkin mutations cause autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson{\&}apos;s disease. Upon a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi(m)) in human cells, cytosolic Parkin has been reported to be recruited to mitochondria, which is followed by a stimulation of mitochondrial autophagy. Here, we show that the relocation of Parkin to mitochondria induced by a collapse of Delta psi(m) relies on PINK1 expression and that overexpression of WT but not of mutated PINK1 causes Parkin translocation to mitochondria, even in cells with normal Delta psi(m). We also show that once at the mitochondria, Parkin is in close proximity to PINK1, but we find no evidence that Parkin catalyzes PINK1 ubiquitination or that PINK1 phosphorylates Parkin. However, co-overexpression of Parkin and PINK1 collapses the normal tubular mitochondrial network into mitochondrial aggregates and/or large perinuclear clusters, many of which are surrounded by autophagic vacuoles. Our results suggest that Parkin, together with PINK1, modulates mitochondrial trafficking, especially to the perinuclear region, a subcellular area associated with autophagy. Thus by impairing this process, mutations in either Parkin or PINK1 may alter mitochondrial turnover which, in turn, may cause the accumulation of defective mitochondria and, ultimately, neurodegeneration in Parkinson{\&}apos;s disease.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Malignant melanoma is responsible for approximately 75{\%} of skin cancer-related deaths. BRAF plays an important role in regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade in melanoma with activating mutations in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF occurring in 60–70{\%} of malignant melanomas. The BRAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway is a key regulator of melanoma cell invasion. In addition, activation of NF$\kappa$B via the MAPK pathway is regulated through MEK-induced activation of IKK. These pathways are potential targets for prevention and treatment of melanoma. In this study, we investigated the effect of fisetin, a phytochemical present in fruits and vegetables, on melanoma cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and delineated the underlying molecular mechanism. Treatment of multiple human malignant melanoma cell lines with fisetin (5–20 µM) resulted in inhibition of cell invasion. BRAF mutated melanoma cells were more sensitive to fisetin treatment, and this was associated with a decrease in the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. In addition, fisetin inhibited the activation of IKK leading to a reduction in the activation of the NF$\kappa$B signaling pathway. Treatment of cells with an inhibitor of MEK1/2 (PD98059) or of NF$\kappa$B (caffeic acid phenethyl ester) also reduced melanoma cell invasion. Furthermore, treatment of fisetin promoted mesenchymal to epithelial transition in melanoma cells, which was associated with a decrease in mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, snail and fibronectin) and an increase in epithelial markers (E-cadherin and desmoglein). Employing three dimensional skin equivalents consisting of A375 cells admixed with normal human keratinocytes embedded onto a collagen-constricted fibroblast matrix, we found that treatment of fisetin reduced the invasive potential of melanoma cells into the dermis and increased the expression of E-cadherin with a concomitant decrease in vimentin. These results indicate that fisetin inhibits melanoma cell invasion through promotion of mesenchymal to epithelial transition and by targeting MAPK and NF$\kappa$B signaling pathways.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The sources and consequences of nongenetic variability in metastatic progression are largely unknown. To address these questions, we characterized a transcriptional regulatory network for the metastasis suppressor Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP). We previously showed that the transcription factor BACH1 is negatively regulated by RKIP and promotes breast cancer metastasis. Here we demonstrate that BACH1 acts in a double-negative (overall positive) feedback loop to inhibit RKIP transcription in breast cancer cells. BACH1 also negatively regulates its own transcription. Analysis of the BACH1 network reveals the existence of an inverse relationship between BACH1 and RKIP involving both monostable and bistable transitions that can potentially give rise to nongenetic variability. Single-cell analysis confirmed monostable and bistable-like behavior. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors or depletion of the polycomb repressor enhancer of zeste homolog 2 altered relative RKIP and BACH1 levels in a manner consistent with a prometastatic state. Together, our results suggest that the mutually repressive relationship between metastatic regulators such as RKIP and BACH1 can play a key role in determining metastatic progression in cancer.},

abstract = {The intracellular storage and utilization of lipids are critical to maintain cellular energy homeostasis. During nutrient deprivation, cellular lipids stored as triglycerides in lipid droplets are hydrolysed into fatty acids for energy. A second cellular response to starvation is the induction of autophagy, which delivers intracellular proteins and organelles sequestered in double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) to lysosomes for degradation and use as an energy source. Lipolysis and autophagy share similarities in regulation and function but are not known to be interrelated. Here we show a previously unknown function for autophagy in regulating intracellular lipid stores (macrolipophagy). Lipid droplets and autophagic components associated during nutrient deprivation, and inhibition of autophagy in cultured hepatocytes and mouse liver increased triglyceride storage in lipid droplets. This study identifies a critical function for autophagy in lipid metabolism that could have important implications for human diseases with lipid over-accumulation such as those that comprise the metabolic syndrome.},

Many mechanisms have been identified in this process that can be rationalized into targeted therapy. Among them, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is originally characterized as a critical step for cell trans-differentiation during embryo development and now recognized in promoting cancer cells invasiveness because of high mobility and migratory abilities of mesenchymal cells once converted from carcinoma cells. Nevertheless, the underlying pathways leading to EMT appear to be very diverse in different cancer types, which certainly represent a challenge for developing effective intervention. In this article, we have carefully reviewed the key factors involved in EMT of PCa with clinical correlation in hope to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategy that is expected to reduce the disease mortality.},

Accurate prediction of TF motifs is critical, because it is infeasible to assay all TFs in all sequenced eukaryotic genomes. There is ongoing controversy regarding the degree of motif diversification among related species that is, in part, because of uncertainty in motif prediction methods. Here we describe similarity regression, a significantly improved method for predicting motifs, which we use to update and expand the Cis-BP database. Similarity regression inherently quantifies TF motif evolution, and shows that previous claims of near-complete conservation of motifs between human and Drosophila are inflated, with nearly half of the motifs in each species absent from the other, largely due to extensive divergence in C2H2 zinc finger proteins. We conclude that diversification in DNA-binding motifs is pervasive, and present a new tool and updated resource to study TF diversity and gene regulation across eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological and incurable malignancy of plasma cells with low proliferative activity in the bone marrow. MM patients initially respond to conventional therapy, however, many develop resistance and recurrences occur. We have identified RKIP as a novel gene product that is differentially overexpressed in MM cell lines and MM tissues compared to other studied tumors and normal bone marrow. This overexpression consisted, in large part, of a phosphorylated inactive form of RKIP at Ser153 (p-Ser153 RKIP). In contrast to RKIP, p-Ser153 RKIP lacks its ability to inhibit the MAPK signaling pathway. The overexpression of p-Ser153 RKIP in MM cell lines and MM tissues was further validated in a mouse model carrying a human MM xenograft, namely, LAG$\lambda$-1B. Bioinformatic analyses from databases support the presence of increased RKIP mRNA expression in MM compared to normal plasma cells. In these databases, high RKIP levels in MM are also correlated with the nonhyperdiploid status and the presence of IgH translocations, parameters that generally display more aggressive clinical features and shorter patients' survival irrespective of the treatment. Since RKIP expression regulates both the NF-$\kappa$B and MAPK survival pathways, the overexpression of "inactive" p-Ser153 RKIP in MM might contribute positively to the overall cell survival/antiapoptotic phenotype and drug resistance of MM through the constitutive activation of survival pathways and downstream the transcription of anti-apoptotic gene products. The overexpression of RKIP and p-Ser153 RKIP in MM is the first demonstration in the literature, since in most tumor tissues the expression of RKIP is very low and the expression of p-Ser153 RKIP is much lower. The relationship between the levels of active RKIP and inactive p-Ser153 RKIP in MM may be of prognostic significance, and the regulation of RKIP activity may be a target for therapeutic intervention.},

Retrotranspositions have independently generated additional YY family members in multiple species. Although Drosophila YY1 [pleiohomeotic (Pho)] and its homolog [pleiohomeotic-like (Phol)] redundantly control homeotic gene expression, the regulatory contributions of YY1-homologs have not yet been examined in other species. Indeed, targets for the mammalian YY1 homolog YY2 are completely unknown. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we found that lentiviral constructs containing short hairpin loop inhibitory RNAs for human YY1 (shYY1) and its homolog YY2 (shYY2) caused significant changes in both shared and distinguishable gene sets in human cells. Ribosomal protein genes were the most significant gene set upregulated by both shYY1 and shYY2, although combined shYY1/2 knock downs were not additive. In contrast, shYY2 reversed the anti-proliferative effects of shYY1, and shYY2 particularly altered UV damage response, platelet-specific and mitochondrial function genes. We found that decreases in YY1 or YY2 caused inverse changes in UV sensitivity, and that their combined loss reversed their respective individual effects. Our studies show that human YY2 is not redundant to YY1, and YY2 is a significant regulator of genes previously identified as uniquely responding to YY1. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.

However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of miR-378 expression. To better understand the physiological role of miR-378 in obesity and metabolic syndrome, it is crucial that we understand the regulation of miR-378 gene expression in human adipocytes. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effects of adipokines and inflammatory cytokines on miR-378 expression using Real-time PCR and the potential regulatory mechanisms using luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Results : We found that adipokines and cytokines upregulated miR-378 expression primarily through SREBP and C/EBP binding sites in the miR-378 promoter region. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that adipokines induced miR-378 expression and revealed the most likely mechanism of adipokine-induced miR-378 dysregulation in human adipocytes. miRNAs have been shown to function in regulating obesity-related metabolic syndrome, and miR-378 may be a novel target for controlling adipose tissue inflammation. This study offers a theoretical basis for understanding systemic adipose tissue inflammation and may provide new strategies for clinical treatment.},

De novo mutations in WDR45 cause beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration characterized by iron accumulation in the basal ganglia. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing of individuals with West syndrome and identified three WDR45 mutations in three independent males (patients 1, 2 and 3). Two novel mutations occurred de novo (patients 1 and 2) and the remaining mutation detected in a male patient (patient 3) and his affected sister was inherited from the mother, harboring the somatic mutation. The three male patients showed early-onset intractable seizures, profound intellectual disability and developmental delay. Their brain magnetic resonance imaging scans showed cerebral atrophy. We found no evidence of somatic mosaicism in the three male patients. Our findings indicate that hemizygous WDR45 mutations in males lead to severe epileptic encephalopathy.Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 31 March 2016; doi:10.1038/jhg.2016.27.},

Mitochondrial responses depend on fusion-fission dynamics that dilute and segregate damaged mitochondria. Mitochondrial motility and inter-organellar interactions, such as with the endoplasmic reticulum, also function in cellular adaptation to stress.

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing movement disabilities and several non-motor symptoms in afflicted patients. Recent studies in animal models of PD and analyses of brain specimen from PD patients revealed an increase in the level and activity of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson (c-Abl) in dopaminergic neurons with phosphorylation of protein substrates, such as $\alpha$-synuclein and the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin. Most significantly inhibition of c-Abl kinase activity by small molecular compounds used in the clinic to treat human leukemia have shown promising neuroprotective effects in cell and animal models of PD. This has raised hope that similar beneficial outcome may also be observed in the treatment of PD patients by using c-Abl inhibitors. Here we highlight the background for the current optimism, reviewing c-Abl and its relationship to pathophysiological pathways prevailing in PD, as well as discussing issues related to the pharmacology and safety of current c-Abl inhibitors. Clearly more rigorously controlled and well-designed trials are needed before the c-Abl inhibitors can be used in the neuroclinic to possibly benefit an increasing number of PD patients.},

CLU is a pleiotropic molecular chaperone that confers survival and proliferative advantage to cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-$\beta$ regulates CLU expression and CLU affects metastasis remain unknown. In this study, we report that the transcription factor Twist1 mediates TGF-$\beta$-induced CLU expression. By binding to E-boxes in the distal promoter region of CLU gene, Twist1 regulated basal and TGF-$\beta$-induced CLU transcription. In addition, CLU reduction reduced TGF-$\beta$ induction of the mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin and fibronectin, thereby inhibiting the migratory and invasive properties induced by TGF-$\beta$. Targeted inhibition of CLU also suppressed metastasis in an in vivo model. Taken together, our findings indicate that CLU is an important mediator of TGF-$\beta$-induced EMT, and suggest that CLU suppression may represent a promising therapeutic option for suppressing prostate cancer metastatic progression.},

Here we report findings that strongly rationalize clinical evaluation of HDACis in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), a class of highly aggressive, therapeutically resistant, and commonly fatal malignancies that occur sporadically or in patients with the inherited neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) syndrome. We evaluated the effects of the chemical HDACis PCI-24781, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, and MS-275 on a panel of human NF1-associated and sporadic MPNSTs in vitro and in vivo. A subset of MPNSTs was found to be highly sensitive to HDACis, especially to PCI-24781. All cell lines in this group were NF1-associated. Significant proapoptotic effects were noted in vitro and in vivo and were independent of p53 mutational status. In contrast, as a group the sporadic-MPNST cells were markedly resistant to HDACi treatment. HDACis were found to induce productive autophagy in MPNST cells. Genetic and/or pharmacologic autophagy blockade resulted in significant HDACi-induced apoptosis in cells defined as resistant or sensitive, leading to abrogated growth of primary tumors and lung metastases in tumor xenograft assays. Among autophagy-associated genes expressed in response to HDACi, the immunity-related GTPase family, M was validated as a critical target in mediating HDACi-induced autophagy and enhanced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings strongly support the evaluation of HDACi currently in clinical trials as an important new therapeutic strategy to treat MPNST, including in combination with autophagy blocking combination regimens in particular for patients with sporadic MPNST.},

High LINC00959 expression was negatively associated with TNM stage, distant metastasis, and lymphatic metastasis, and correlated with a better prognosis in 87 CRC cases. In vitro, LINC00959 knockdown enhanced colon cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration; upregulated N-cadherin and vimentin; and downregulated E-cadherin and Caspase-3. LINC00959 overexpression produced the opposite effects.

abstract = {The protein Vezf1 plays multiple roles important for embryonic development. In Vezf1(-/-) mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells, our earlier data showed widespread changes in gene-expression profiles, including decreased expression of the full-length active isoform of Dnmt3b methyltransferase and concomitant genome-wide reduction in DNA methylation. Here we show that in HeLaS3 cells there is a strong genome-wide correlation between Vezf1 binding and peaks of elongating Ser2-P RNA polymerase (Pol) ll, reflecting Vezf1-dependent slowing of elongation. In WT mES cells, the elongating form of RNA pol II accumulates near Vezf1 binding sites within the dnmt3b gene and at several other Vezf1 sites, and this accumulation is significantly reduced at these sites in Vezf1(-/-) mES cells. Depending upon genomic location, Vezf1-mediated Pol II pausing can have different regulatory roles in transcription and splicing. We find examples of genes in which Vezf1 binding sites are located near cassette exons, and in which loss of Vezf1 leads to a change in the relative abundance of alternatively spliced messages. We further show that Vezf1 interacts with Mrg15/Mrgbp, a protein that recognizes H3K36 trimethylation, consistent with the role of histone modifications at alternatively spliced sites.},

abstract = {Genes with common functions often exhibit correlated expression levels, which can be used to identify sets of interacting genes from microarray data. Microarrays typically measure expression across genomic space, creating a massive matrix of co-expression that must be mined to extract only the most relevant gene interactions. We describe a graph theoretical approach to extracting co-expressed sets of genes, based on the computation of cliques. Unlike the results of traditional clustering algorithms, cliques are not disjoint and allow genes to be assigned to multiple sets of interacting partners, consistent with biological reality. A graph is created by thresholding the correlation matrix to include only the correlations most likely to signify functional relationships. Cliques computed from the graph correspond to sets of genes for which significant edges are present between all members of the set, representing potential members of common or interacting pathways. Clique membership can be used to infer function about poorly annotated genes, based on the known functions of better-annotated genes with which they share clique membership (i.e., "guilt-by-association"). We illustrate our method by applying it to microarray data collected from the spleens of mice exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation. Differential analysis is used to identify sets of genes whose interactions are impacted by radiation exposure. The correlation graph is also queried independently of clique to extract edges that are impacted by radiation. We present several examples of multiple gene interactions that are altered by radiation exposure and thus represent potential molecular pathways that mediate the radiation response.},

abstract = {Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), an endogenous inhibitor of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, has been implicated as a suppressor of metastasis and a prognostic marker in cancers. However, how RKIP acts as a suppressor during metastasis is not fully understood. Here, we show that RKIP activity in cervical and stomach cancer is inversely correlated with endogenous levels of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), which stimulates the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. The levels of RKIP were significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, whereas NICD levels were increased. Overexpression of RKIP in several cell lines resulted in a dramatic decrease of NICD and subsequent inhibition of several mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin, N-cadherin, and Snail. In contrast, knockdown of RKIP exhibited opposite results both in vitro and in vivo using mouse models. Nevertheless, knockdown of Notch1 in cancer cells had no effect on the expression of RKIP, suggesting that RKIP is likely an upstream regulator of the Notch1 pathway. We also found that RKIP directly interacts with Notch1 but has no influence on the intracellular level of the gamma-secretase complex that is necessary for Notch1 activation. These data suggest that RKIP plays a distinct role in activation of Notch1 during EMT and metastasis, providing a new target for cancer treatment.},

Circulatory forms of miRNAs have been detected in serum and hold promise as minimally invasive cancer biomarkers. This study aimed to identify potential circulatory miRNAs that can provide insights into new mechanisms for clinical diagnosis of PCa and can serve as potential biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets. Candidate serum miRNAs were detected by using PCR microarray in a learning set of six African American (AA) and six Caucasian American (CA) PCa patients. Discriminating performance of candidate miRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR in serum samples from 36 AA (24 PCa patients and 12 controls) and 36 CA (16 PCa patients and 20 controls). From the miRNA profiling experiments, three differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-25, miR-101, and miR-628-5p) were selected for future validation. In the validation set, there was an overall low expression of miR-25 (p {\textless} 0.01), miR-101 (p {\textless} 0.001), and miR-628-5p (p {\textless} 0.0001) in serum of PCa patients as compared with normal individuals. Subdivision on the basis of ethnicity showed that serum expression levels of miR-628-5p were significantly downregulated in both AA and CA PCa patients when compared with their respective controls. Our results demonstrate that the three miRNAs, particularly miR-628-5p, may be further developed as a biomarker, which can serve as novel noninvasive biomarker for PCa diagnosis and prognosis.},

abstract = {The identification of factors that define adipocyte precursor potential has important implications for obesity. Preadipocytes are fibroblastoid cells committed to becoming round lipid-laden adipocytes. In vitro, this differentiation process is facilitated by confluency, followed by adipogenic stimuli. During adipogenesis, a large number of cytostructural genes are repressed before adipocyte gene induction. Here we report that the transcriptional repressor transcription factor 7-like 1 (TCF7L1) binds and directly regulates the expression of cell structure genes. Depletion of TCF7L1 inhibits differentiation, because TCF7L1 indirectly induces the adipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ in a manner that can be replaced by inhibition of myosin II activity. TCF7L1 is induced by cell contact in adipogenic cell lines, and ectopic expression of TCF7L1 alleviates the confluency requirement for adipocytic differentiation of precursor cells. In contrast, TCF7L1 is not induced during confluency of non-adipogenic fibroblasts, and, remarkably, forced expression of TCF7L1 is sufficient to commit non-adipogenic fibroblasts to an adipogenic fate. These results establish TCF7L1 as a transcriptional hub coordinating cell-cell contact with the transcriptional repression required for adipogenic competency.},

Regulation of osteoclast differentiation and activity is important for the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases associated with bone loss. Here, we demonstrate that retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are key elements of the transcriptional program of differentiating osteoclasts. Loss of RXR function in hematopoietic cells resulted in formation of giant, nonresorbing osteoclasts and increased bone mass in male mice and protected female mice from bone loss following ovariectomy, which induces osteoporosis in WT females. The increase in bone mass associated with RXR deficiency was due to lack of expression of the RXR-dependent transcription factor v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family, protein B (MAFB) in osteoclast progenitors. Evaluation of osteoclast progenitor cells revealed that RXR homodimers directly target and bind to the Mafb promoter, and this interaction is required for proper osteoclast proliferation, differentiation, and activity. Pharmacological activation of RXRs inhibited osteoclast differentiation due to the formation of RXR/liver X receptor (LXR) heterodimers, which induced expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), resulting in indirect MAFB upregulation. Our study reveals that RXR signaling mediates bone homeostasis and suggests that RXRs have potential as targets for the treatment of bone pathologies such as osteoporosis.},

HDX-MS shows that Atg38 binds the Vps30-Atg14 subcomplex of complex I, using mainly its N-terminal MIT domain and bridges the coiled-coil I regions of Atg14 and Vps30 in the base of complex I. The Atg38 C-terminal domain is important for localization to the phagophore assembly site (PAS) and homodimerization. Our 2.2 A resolution crystal structure of the Atg38 C-terminal homodimerization domain shows 2 segments of alpha-helices assembling into a mushroom-like asymmetric homodimer with a 4-helix cap and a parallel coiled-coil stalk. One Atg38 homodimer engages a single complex I. This is in sharp contrast to human NRBF2, which also forms a homodimer, but this homodimer can bridge 2 complex I assemblies.},

abstract = {We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in mammalian cells. By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

@article{Liu2014a,
abstract = {Metastasis is the process of primary tumor cells breaking away and colonizing distant secondary sites. In order for a tumor cell growing in one microenvironment to travel to, and flourish in, a secondary environment, it must survive a series of events termed the metastatic cascade. Before departing the primary tumor, cells acquire genetic and epigenetic changes that endow them with properties not usually associated with related normal differentiated cells. Those cells also induce a subset of bone marrow-derived stem cells to mobilize and establish pre-metastatic niches [1]. Many tumor cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), where they transiently acquire morphologic changes, reduced requirements for cell-cell contact and become more invasive [2]. Invasive tumor cells eventually enter the circulatory (hematogenous) or lymphatic systems or travel across body cavities. In transit, tumor cells must resist anoikis, survive sheer forces and evade detection by the immune system. For blood-borne metastases, surviving cells then arrest or adhere to endothelial linings before either proliferating or extravasating. Eventually, tumor cells complete the process by proliferating to form a macroscopic mass [3].Up to 90 {\%} of all cancer related morbidity and mortality can be attributed to metastasis. Surgery manages to ablate most primary tumors, especially when combined with chemotherapy and radiation. But if cells have disseminated, survival rates drop precipitously. While multiple parameters of the primary tumor are predictive of local or distant relapse, biopsies remain an imperfect science. The introduction of molecular and other biomarkers [4, 5] continue to improve the accuracy of prognosis. However, the invasive procedure introduces new complications for the patient. Likewise, the heterogeneity of any tumor population [3, 6, 7] means that sampling error (i.e., since it is impractical to examine the entire tumor) necessitates further improvements.In the case of breast cancer, for example, women diagnosed with stage I diseases (i.e., no evidence of invasion through a basement membrane) still have a {\~{}}30 {\%} likelihood of developing distant metastases [8]. Many physicians and patients opt for additional chemotherapy in order to "mop up" cells that have disseminated and have the potential to grow into macroscopic metastases. This means that {\~{}} 70 {\%} of patients receive unnecessary therapy, which has undesirable side effects. Therefore, improving prognostic capability is highly desirable.Recent advances allow profiling of primary tumor DNA sequences and gene expression patterns to define a so-called metastatic signature [9-11], which can be predictive of patient outcome. However, the genetic changes that a tumor cell must undergo to survive the initial events of the metastatic cascade and colonize a second location belie a plasticity that may not be adequately captured in a sampling of heterogeneous tumors. In order to tailor or personalize patient treatments, a more accurate assessment of the genetic profile in the metastases is needed. Biopsy of each individual metastasis is not practical, safe, nor particularly cost-effective. In recent years, there has been a resurrection of the notion to do a 'liquid biopsy,' which essentially involves sampling of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and/or cell free nucleic acids (cfDNA, including microRNA (miRNA)) present in blood and lymph [12-16].The rationale for liquid biopsy is that tumors shed cells and/or genetic fragments into the circulation, theoretically making the blood representative of not only the primary tumor but also distant metastases. Logically, one would predict that the proportion of CTC and/or cfDNA would be proportionate to the likelihood of developing metastases [14]. While a linear relationship does not exist, the information within CTC or cfDNA is beginning to show great promise for enabling a global snapshot of the disease. However, the CTC and cfDNA are present at extremely low levels. Nonetheless, newer technologies capture enough material to enrich and sequence the patient's DNA or quantification of some biomarkers.Among the biomarkers showing great promise are metastasis suppressors which, by definition, block a tumor cell's ability to complete the metastatic process without prohibiting primary tumor growth [17]. Since the discovery of the first metastasis suppressor, Nm23, more than 30 have been functionally characterized. They function at various stages of the metastatic cascade, but their mechanisms of action, for the most part, remain ill-defined. Deciphering the molecular interactions of functional metastasis suppressors may provide insights for targeted therapies when these regulators cease to function and result in metastatic disease.In this brief review, we summarize what is known about the various metastasis suppressors and their functions at individual steps of the metastatic cascade (Table 1). Some of the subdivisions are rather arbitrary in nature, since many metastasis suppressors affect more than one step in the metastatic cascade. Nonetheless what emerges is a realization that metastasis suppressors are intimately associated with the microenvironments in which cancer cells find themselves [18].},

abstract = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional cancer therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. PDT com-prises the administration of a photosensitizer, its accumu-lation in tumor tissue, and subsequent irradiation of the photosensitizer-loaded tumor, leading to the localized photoproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The resulting oxidative damage ultimately culminates in tumor cell death, vascular shutdown, induction of an antitumor immune response, and the consequent destruction of the tumor. However, the ROS produced by PDT also triggers a stress response that, as part of a cell survival mecha-nism, helps cancer cells to cope with the PDT-induced oxidative stress and cell damage. These survival pathways are mediated by the transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP-1), nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), nuclear factor $\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B), and those that mediate the proteotoxic stress response. The survival pathways are believed to render some types of cancer recalcitrant to PDT and alter the tumor microenvironment in favor of tumor survival. In this review, the molecular mechanisms are elucidated that occur post-PDT to mediate cancer cell survival, on the basis of which pharmacological interventions are proposed. Specifically, phar-maceutical inhibitors of the molecular regulators of each sur-vival pathway are addressed. The ultimate aim is to facilitate the development of adjuvant intervention strategies to improve PDT efficacy in recalcitrant solid tumors.},

abstract = {The AMP-activated protein kinase has been purified by affinity chromatography on ATP-gamma-Sepharose. A proportion of the activity can be eluted using AMP, while the remainder is eluted using ATP. The AMP eluate contains three polypeptides of 63, 38 and 35 kDa (p63, p38 and p35) in a molar ratio (by Coomassie blue binding) close to 1:1:1. p63 was previously identified as the AMP-binding catalytic subunit [Carling, D., Clarke, P. R., Zammit, V. A. {\&} Hardie, D. G. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 186, 129-136]. All three polypeptides exactly comigrate both on native gel electrophoresis and on gel filtration, suggesting that p38 and p35 are additional subunits. Estimation of Stokes radius (5.4-5.8 nm) by gel filtration, and sedimentation coefficient (7.9-8.4 S) by glycerol gradient centrifugation, suggest that the kinase has an asymmetric structure with a native molecular mass for the complex of 190 +/- 10 kDa. Thus the native enzyme appears to be a heterotrimer with a p63/p38/p35 (1:1:1) structure. Despite the fact that the ATP eluate has a higher specific activity than the AMP eluate (3.5 +/- 0.2 vs 2.3 +/- 0.2 mumol.min-1.mg-1), it appears to be less pure, containing p63, p38 and p35 plus other polypeptides. Experiments examining the effects of protein phosphatase-2A and kinase kinase, and analysis by Western blotting with anti-p63 antibody, suggests that the AMP eluate is entirely in the low-activity dephosphorylated form, while the ATP eluate is a mixture of that form and the high-activity phosphorylated form. As well as establishing the subunit structure of the AMP-activated protein kinase, these results suggest that the kinase can bind to ATP-gamma-Sepharose through either the allosteric (AMP/ATP) site or the catalytic (ATP) site, and that phosphorylation by the kinase kinase increases the affinity for the latter site.},

abstract = {Neuroblastoma, a rapidly growing yet treatment responsive cancer, is the third most common cancer of children and the most common solid tumor in infants. Unfortunately, neuroblastoma that has lost p53 function often has a highly treatment-resistant phenotype leading to tragic outcomes. In the context of neuroblastoma, the functions of p53 and MYCN (which is amplified in {\~{}}25{\%} of neuroblastomas) are integrally linked because they are mutually transcriptionally regulated, and because they together regulate the catalytic activity of RNA polymerases. Didymin is a citrus-derived natural compound that kills p53 wild-type as well as drug-resistant p53-mutant neuroblastoma cells in culture. In addition, orally administered didymin causes regression of neuroblastoma xenografts in mouse models, without toxicity to non-malignant cells, neural tissues, or neural stem cells. RKIP is a Raf-inhibitory protein that regulates MYCN activation, is transcriptionally upregulated by didymin, and appears to play a key role in the anti-neuroblastoma actions of didymin. In this review, we discuss how didymin overcomes drug-resistance in p53-mutant neuroblastoma through RKIP-mediated inhibition of MYCN and its effects on GRK2, PKCs, Let-7 micro-RNA, and clathrin-dependent endocytosis by Raf-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In addition, we will discuss studies supporting potential clinical impact and translation of didymin as a low cost, safe, and effective oral agent that could change the current treatment paradigm for refractory neuroblastoma.},

Although multiple studies have investigated the adipogenic stem and precursor cells that give rise to mature adipocytes 3-14 , our understanding of their in vivo origin and properties is incomplete 2,15,16 . This is partially due to the highly heterogeneous and unstructured nature of adipose tissue depots 17 , which has proven difficult to molecularly dissect using classical approaches such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Cre-lox lines based on candidate marker genes 16,18 . Here, using the resolving power of single-cell transcriptomics 19 in a mouse model, we reveal distinct subpopulations of adipose stem and precursor cells in the stromal vascular fraction of subcutaneous adipose tissue. We identify one of these subpopulations as CD142 + adipogenesis-regulatory cells, which can suppress adipocyte formation in vivo and in vitro in a paracrine manner. We show that adipogenesis-regulatory cells are refractory to adipogenesis and that they are functionally conserved in humans. Our findings point to a potentially critical role for adipogenesis-regulatory cells in modulating adipose tissue plasticity, which is linked to metabolic control, differential insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as important post-transcriptional regulators involved in various biological and pathological processes of cells, but their underlying mechanisms in chemosensitivity and metastasis have not been fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to identify miR-181b and its mechanism in the chemosensitivity and metastasis of NSCLC. We found that miR-181b expression levels were lower in A549/DDP cells compared with A549 cells. Functional assays showed that the overexpression of miR-181b inhibited proliferation, enhanced chemosensitivity to DDP, attenuated migration and metastatic ability in NSCLC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. TGFbetaR1 was subsequently identified as a novel functional target of miR-181b. TGFbetaR1 knockdown revealed similar effects as that of ectopic miR-181b expression, whereas overexpression of TGFbetaR1 rescued the function of miR-181b-mediated growth, chemosensitivity and metastasis in NSCLC cells. In addition, miR-181b could inactivate the TGFbetaR1/Smad signaling pathway. We also observed that decreased miR-181b expression and increased TGFbetaR1 expression were significantly associated with chemosensitivity to DDP and tumor metastasis in NSCLC patients. Consequently, miR-181b functions as a tumor suppressor and has an important role in proliferation, chemosensitivity to DDP and metastasis of NSCLC by targeting TGFbetaR1/Smad signaling pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutations in the SQSTM1/p62 gene have been reported in Paget's disease of bone (PDB), but they are not sufficient to induce the pagetic osteoclast (OC) phenotype. We hypothesized that specific RNA isoforms of OC-related genes may contribute to the overactivity of pagetic OCs, along with other genetic predisposing factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Alternative splicing (AS) events were studied using a PCR-based screening strategy in OC cultures from 29 patients with PDB and 26 healthy donors (HD), all genotyped for the p62P392L mutation. Primer pairs targeting 5223 characterized AS events were used to analyze relative isoform ratios on pooled cDNA from samples of the four groups (PDB, PDBP392L, HD, HDP392L). Of the 1056 active AS events detected in the screening analysis, 192 were re-analyzed on non-amplified cDNA from each subject of the whole cohort.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: This analysis led to the identification of six AS events significantly associated with PDB, but none with p62P392L. The corresponding genes included LGALS8, RHOT1, CASC4, USP4, TBC1D25, and PIDD. In addition, RHOT1 and LGALS8 genes were upregulated in pagetic OCs, as were CASC4 and RHOT1 genes in the presence of p62P392L. Finally, we showed that the proteins encoded by LGALS8, RHOT1, USP4, TBC1D25, and PIDD were expressed in human OCs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This study allowed the identification of hitherto unknown players in OC biology, and our findings of a differential AS in pagetic OCs may generate new concepts in the pathogenesis of PDB.},

abstract = {Extensive research during the past 2 decades has revealed the mechanism by which continued oxidative stress can lead to chronic inflammation, which in turn could mediate most chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular, neurological, and pulmonary diseases. Oxidative stress can activate a variety of transcription factors including NF-$\kappa$B, AP-1, p53, HIF-1$\alpha$, PPAR-$\gamma$, $\beta$-catenin/Wnt, and Nrf2. Activation of these transcription factors can lead to the expression of over 500 different genes, including those for growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, cell cycle regulatory molecules, and anti-inflammatory molecules. How oxidative stress activates inflammatory pathways leading to transformation of a normal cell to tumor cell, tumor cell survival, proliferation, chemoresistance, radioresistance, invasion, angiogenesis, and stem cell survival is the focus of this review. Overall, observations to date suggest that oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and cancer are closely linked. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Little is known about the function of microRNA-224 (miR-224) in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). This study investigated the role of miR-224 expression in MTC and correlated it with mutation status in sporadic MTCs. A consecutive series of 134 MTCs were considered. Patients had a sporadic form in 80{\%} of cases (107/134). In this group, REarranged during transfection ( RET ) and rat sarcoma ( RAS ) mutation status were assessed by direct sequencing in the tumor tissues. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify mature hsa-miR-224 in tumor tissue. RAS (10/107 cases, 9{\%}) and RET (39/107 cases, 36{\%}) mutations were mutually exclusive in sporadic cases. miR-224 expression was significantly downregulated in patients with the following: high calcitonin levels at diagnosis ( p = 0.03 , r = − 0.3 ); advanced stage ( p = 0.001 ); persistent disease ( p = 0.001 ); progressive disease ( p = 0.002 ); and disease-related death ( p = 0.0001 ). We found a significant positive correlation between miR-224 expression and somatic RAS mutations ( p = 0.007 ). Patients whose MTCs had a low miR-224 expression tended to have a shorter overall survival (log-rank test p = 0.005 ). On multivariate analysis, miR-224 represented an independent prognostic marker. Our data indicate that miR-224 is upregulated in RAS -mutated MTCs and in patients with a better prognosis and could represent an independent prognostic marker in MTC patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide linkage studies have identified the 9q22 chromosomal region as linked with colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition. A candidate gene in this region is transforming growth factor $\beta$ receptor 1 (TGFBR1). Investigation of TGFBR1 has focused on the common genetic variant rs11466445, a short exonic deletion of nine base pairs which results in truncation of a stretch of nine alanine residues to six alanine residues in the gene product. While the six alanine (*6A) allele has been reported to be associated with increased risk of CRC in some population based study groups this association remains the subject of robust debate. To date, reports have been limited to population-based case-control association studies, or case-control studies of CRC families selecting one affected individual per family. No study has yet taken advantage of all the genetic information provided by multiplex CRC families.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We have tested for an association between rs11466445 and risk of CRC using several family-based statistical tests in a new study group comprising members of non-syndromic high risk CRC families sourced from three familial cancer centres, two in Australia and one in Spain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We report a finding of a nominally significant result using the pedigree-based association test approach (PBAT; p = 0.028), while other family-based tests were non-significant, but with a p-value {\textless}; 0.10 in each instance. These other tests included the Generalised Disequilibrium Test (GDT; p = 0.085), parent of origin GDT Generalised Disequilibrium Test (GDT-PO; p = 0.081) and empirical Family-Based Association Test (FBAT; p = 0.096, additive model). Related-person case-control testing using the "More Powerful" Quasi-Likelihood Score Test did not provide any evidence for association (MQLS; p = 0.41).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: After conservatively taking into account considerations for multiple hypothesis testing, we find little evidence for an association between the TGFBR1*6A allele and CRC risk in these families. The weak support for an increase in risk in CRC predisposed families is in agreement with recent meta-analyses of case-control studies, which estimate only a modest increase in sporadic CRC risk among 6*A allele carriers.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a catabolic process aimed at recycling cellular components and damaged organelles in response to diverse conditions of stress, such as nutrient deprivation, viral infection and genotoxic stress. A growing amount of evidence in recent years argues for oxidative stress acting as the converging point of these stimuli, with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) being among the main intracellular signal transducers sustaining autophagy. This review aims at providing novel insight into the regulatory pathways of autophagy in response to glucose and amino acid deprivation, as well as their tight interconnection with metabolic networks and redox homeostasis. The role of oxidative and nitrosative stress in autophagy is also discussed in the light of its being harmful for both cellular biomolecules and signal mediator through reversible posttranslational modifications of thiol-containing proteins. The redox-independent relationship between autophagy and antioxidant response, occurring through the p62/Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, is also addressed in order to provide a wide perspective upon the interconnection between autophagy and oxidative stress. Herein, we also attempt to afford an overview of the complex crosstalk between autophagy and DNA damage response (DDR), focusing on the main pathways activated upon ROS and RNS overproduction. Along these lines, the direct and indirect role of autophagy in DDR is dissected in depth.},

Since its creation, MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and cancer to include {\textgreater}10,000 gene sets. These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of "hallmark" gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.},

abstract = {Cationic nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted gene delivery are conventionally evaluated using 2D in vitro cultures. However, this does not translate well to corresponding in vivo studies because of the marked difference in NP behavior in the presence of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we investigated whether prostate cancer (PCa) cells cultured in three-dimensional (3D) chitosan-alginate (CA) porous scaffolds could model cationic NP-mediated gene targeted delivery to tumors in vitro. We assessed in vitro tumor cell proliferation, formation of tumor spheroids, and expression of marker genes that promote tumor malignancy in CA scaffolds. The efficacy of NP-targeted gene delivery was evaluated in PCa cells in 2D cultures, PCa tumor spheroids grown in CA scaffolds, and PCa tumors in a mouse TRAMP-C2 flank tumor model. PCa cells cultured in CA scaffolds grew into tumor spheroids and displayed characteristics of higher malignancy as compared to those in 2D cultures. Significantly, targeted gene delivery was only observed in cells cultured in CA scaffolds, whereas cells cultured on 2D plates showed no difference in gene delivery between targeted and nontarget control NPs. In vivo NP evaluation confirmed targeted gene delivery, indicating that only CA scaffolds correctly modeled NP-mediated targeted delivery in vivo. These findings suggest that CA scaffolds serve as a better in vitro platform than 2D cultures for evaluation of NP-mediated targeted gene delivery to PCa.},

abstract = {Many genes can play a role in multiple biological processes or molecular functions. Identifying multifunctional genes at the genome-wide level and studying their properties can shed light upon the complexity of molecular events that underpin cellular functioning, thereby leading to a better understanding of the functional landscape of the cell. However, to date, genome-wide analysis of multifunctional genes (and the proteins they encode) has been limited. Here we introduce a computational approach that uses known functional annotations to extract genes playing a role in at least two distinct biological processes. We leverage functional genomics data sets for three organisms-H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, and S. cerevisiae-and show that, as compared to other annotated genes, genes involved in multiple biological processes possess distinct physicochemical properties, are more broadly expressed, tend to be more central in protein interaction networks, tend to be more evolutionarily conserved, and are more likely to be essential. We also find that multifunctional genes are significantly more likely to be involved in human disorders. These same features also hold when multifunctionality is defined with respect to molecular functions instead of biological processes. Our analysis uncovers key features about multifunctional genes, and is a step towards a better genome-wide understanding of gene multifunctionality.},

How TFs can efficiently find their sites following these stages has been unclear. Here, we have analyzed the binding pattern of expressed TFs in human colorectal cancer cells. We find that binding of TFs is highly clustered and that the clusters are enriched in binding motifs for several major TF classes. Strikingly, almost all clusters are formed around cohesin, and loss of cohesin decreases both DNA accessibility and binding of TFs to clusters. We show that cohesin remains bound in S phase, holding the nascent sister chromatids together at the TF cluster sites. Furthermore, cohesin remains bound to the cluster sites when TFs are evicted in early M phase. These results suggest that cohesin-binding functions as a cellular memory that promotes re-establishment of TF clusters after DNA replication and chromatin condensation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

With the discovery of (V600E)BRAF in about 50{\%} of cutaneous melanomas, there was an increased effort to find additional mutations. However, mutations characterized in melanoma to date cannot account for the development of all melanomas. With the discovery of microRNAs as important players in melanomagenesis, protein mutations are no longer considered the sole drivers of tumors. Recent research findings have expanded the view for tumor initiation and progression to additional non-coding RNAs. The data suggest that tumorigenesis is likely an interplay between mutated proteins and deregulation of non-coding RNAs in the cell with an additional role of the tumor environment. With the exception of microRNAs, our knowledge of the role of non-coding RNAs in melanoma is in its infancy. Using few examples, we will summarize some of the roles of non-coding RNAs in tumorigenesis. Thus, there is a whole world beyond protein-coding sequences and microRNAs, which can cause melanoma.},

In recent years, artemisinin and its derivs., such as dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which were traditionally used as anti-malarial agent, have been shown to inhibit tumor growth with low toxicity to normal cells.  In this study, we investigated mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor effect of DHA in cervical cancer.  We evaluated the role of DHA on the expression of bcl-2 and Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), which is a suppressor of metastasis.  The MTT assay was used to compare the proliferation of untreated and DHA-treated Hela and Caski cervical cancer cells.  Flow cytometry was used to det. the percentage of cells at each stage of the cell cycle in untreated and DHA-treated cells.  We used RT-PCR and western blots to det. the expression of bcl-2 and RKIP mRNA and proteins.  We evaluated the effect of DHA treatment in nude mice bearing Hela or Caski tumors.  DHA-treated cells showed a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation and a significant increase in apoptosis.  The expression of RKIP was significantly upregulated and the expression of bcl-2 was significantly downregulated in DHA-treated cells compared with control cells.  DHA treatment caused (1) a significant inhibition of tumor growth and (2) a significant increase in the apoptotic index in nude mice bearing Hela or Caski tumors.  Our data suggest that DHA inhibits cervical cancer growth via upregulation of RKIP and downregulation of bcl-2. [on SciFinder(R)]},

The traditional Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high phenolic-rich foods intake, including extra-virgin olive oil, nuts, red wine, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole-grain cereals. Evidence for polyphenols' effect on obesity and weight control in humans is inconsistent and the health effects of polyphenols depend on the amount consumed and their bioavailability. The mechanisms involved in weight loss in which polyphenols may have a role are: activating $\beta$-oxidation; a prebiotic effect for gut microbiota; inducing satiety; stimulating energy expenditure by inducing thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue; modulating adipose tissue inhibiting adipocyte differentiation; promoting adipocyte apoptosis and increasing lipolysis. Even though the intake of some specific polyphenols has been associated with body weight changes, there is still no evidence for the effects of total polyphenols or some polyphenol subclasses in humans on adiposity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we investigated the effect of the deletion of an essential autophagy gene, autophagy-related gene 7 (atg7), on adipogenesis. A mouse model with a targeted deletion of atg7 in adipose tissue was generated. The mutant mice were slim and contained only 20{\%} of the mass of white adipose tissue (WAT) found in wild-type mice.

These cells exhibited altered fatty acid metabolism with increased rates of beta-oxidation and reduced rates of hormone-induced lipolysis. Consistently, the mutant mice had lower fed plasma concentrations of fatty acids and the levels decreased at faster rates upon insulin stimuli. These mutant mice exhibited increased insulin sensitivity. The mutant mice also exhibited markedly decreased plasma concentrations of leptin but not adiponectin, lower plasma concentrations of triglyceride and cholesterol, and they had higher levels of basal physical activity. Strikingly, these mutant mice were resistant to high-fat-diet-induced obesity. Taken together, our results indicate that atg7, and by inference autophagy, plays an important role in normal adipogenesis and that inhibition of autophagy by disrupting the atg7 gene has a unique anti-obesity and insulin sensitization effect.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly associated with a modern lifestyle. The prevalence of MetS has reached epidemic proportion and is still rising. The main cause of MetS and finally type 2 diabetes occurrence is excessive nutrient intake, lack of physical activity, and inflammatory cytokines secretion. These factors lead to redistribution of body fat and oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurrence, resulting in insulin resistance, increase adipocyte differentiation, and much elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Cellular therapies, especially mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation, seem to be promising in the MetS and type 2 diabetes treatments, due to their immunomodulatory effect and multipotent capacity; adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) play a crucial role in MSC-based cellular therapies. In this review, we focused on etiopathology of MetS, especially on the crosstalk between chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and ER stress and their effect on MetS-related disease occurrence, as well as future perspectives of cellular therapies. We also provide an overview of therapeutic approaches that target endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we show an alternative and previously unknown bivalent modified histone signature in lineage-committed mesenchymal stem cells and preadipocytes that pairs H3K4me3 with H3K9me3 to maintain adipogenic master regulatory genes (Cebpa and Pparg) expressed at low levels yet poised for activation when differentiation is required. We show lineage-specific gene-body DNA methylation recruits H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1, which methylates H3K9 immediately downstream of transcription start sites marked with H3K4me3 to establish the bivalent domain. At the Cebpa locus, this prevents transcription factor C/EBP$\beta$ binding, histone acetylation, and further H3K4me3 deposition and is associated with pausing of RNA polymerase II, which limits Cebpa gene expression and adipogenesis.},

abstract = {Orlistat, a lipase inhibitor, acts locally in the gastrointestinal tract. Systemic absorption is not required for its efficacy, but knowledge of the extent of its systemic absorption is important for its safe use in obese patients, the intended target population. Pharmacokinetic screening was carried out by monitoring plasma concentrations of unchanged orlistat in 25 phase 1 studies (including two mass balance studies) in normal and obese healthy volunteers. The results of these studies indicate an extremely low degree of systemic absorption for orlistat when administered with a hypocaloric, well-balanced diet with 20{\%} to 30{\%} of calories derived from fat (50-80 gm). To further characterize the pharmacokinetics and excretion pathways of orlistat, two mass balance studies using 14C-labeled orlistat were conducted. After oral dosing of radiolabeled orlistat with a fatty meal (28-30 gm fat), almost the entire dose was recovered from fecal samples; little was found in plasma and urine. It is concluded that systemic absorption of orlistat is negligible; at a clinically efficacious dose level, orlistat is unlikely to produce systemic lipase inhibition.},

abstract = {The diverse transcriptional mechanisms governing cellular differentiation and development of mammalian tissue remains poorly understood. Here we report that TAF7L, a paralogue of TFIID subunit TAF7, is enriched in adipocytes and white fat tissue (WAT) in mouse. Depletion of TAF7L reduced adipocyte-specific gene expression, compromised adipocyte differentiation, and WAT development as well. Ectopic expression of TAF7L in myoblasts reprograms these muscle precursors into adipocytes upon induction. Genome-wide mRNA-seq expression profiling and ChIP-seq binding studies confirmed that TAF7L is required for activating adipocyte-specific genes via a dual mechanism wherein it interacts with PPAR$\gamma$ at enhancers and TBP/Pol II at core promoters. In vitro binding studies confirmed that TAF7L forms complexes with both TBP and PPAR$\gamma$. These findings suggest that TAF7L plays an integral role in adipocyte gene expression by targeting enhancers as a cofactor for PPAR$\gamma$ and promoters as a component of the core transcriptional machinery.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00170.001.},

Overexpression of Snail has been associated with breast cancer metastasis, although the specific role of Snail in the process remains unclear. To address this issue, the expression levels of Snail, RhoA and fibronectin, as well as MMP-2, were reduced in the breast tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435S, and their biological responses were studied in vitro and in vivo. For the first time, it was observed that downregulated Snail expression is correlated with a significant inhibition of the expression and activity of RhoA GTPase, as well as MMP-2. The present data provide evidence that Snail promotes tumor cell motility and angiogenesis which is mainly mediated through the regulation of RhoA activity. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate a key regulatory role for Snail in breast tumor growth and progression.},

abstract = {Patterns of coexpression can reveal networks of functionally related genes and provide deeper understanding of processes requiring multiple gene products. We performed an analysis of coexpression networks for 1,330 genes from the AraCyc database of metabolic pathways in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We found that genes associated with the same metabolic pathway are, on average, more highly coexpressed than genes from different pathways. Positively coexpressed genes within the same pathway tend to cluster close together in the pathway structure, while negatively correlated genes typically occupy more distant positions. The distribution of coexpression links per gene is highly skewed, with a small but significant number of genes having numerous coexpression partners but most having fewer than 10. Genes with multiple connections (hubs) tend to be single-copy genes, while genes with multiple paralogs are coexpressed with fewer genes, on average, than single-copy genes, suggesting that the network expands through gene duplication, followed by weakening of coexpression links involving duplicate nodes. Using a network-analysis algorithm based on coexpression with multiple pathway members (pathway-level coexpression), we identified and prioritized novel candidate pathway members, regulators, and cross pathway transcriptional control points for over 140 metabolic pathways. To facilitate exploration and analysis of the results, we provide a Web site (http://www.transvar.org/at{\_}coexpress/analysis/web) listing analyzed pathways with links to regression and pathway-level coexpression results. These methods and results will aid in the prioritization of candidates for genetic analysis of metabolism in plants and contribute to the improvement of functional annotation of the Arabidopsis genome.},

abstract = {The very small fraction of putative binding sites (BSs) that are occupied by transcription factors (TFs) in vivo can be highly variable across different cell types. This observation has been partly attributed to changes in chromatin accessibility and histone modification (HM) patterns surrounding BSs. Previous studies focusing on BSs within DNA regulatory regions found correlations between HM patterns and TF binding specificities. However, a mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding specificity determinants is still not available. The ability to predict in vivo TF binding on a genome-wide scale requires the identification of features that determine TF binding based on evolutionary relationships of DNA binding proteins. To reveal protein family-dependent mechanisms of TF binding, we conducted comprehensive comparisons of HM patterns surrounding BSs and non-BSs with exactly matched core motifs for TFs in three cell lines: 33 TFs in GM12878, 37 TFs in K562, and 18 TFs in H1-hESC. These TFs displayed protein family-specific preferences for HM patterns surrounding BSs, with high agreement among cell lines. Moreover, compared to models based on DNA sequence and shape at flanking regions of BSs, HM-augmented quantitative machine-learning methods resulted in increased performance in a TF family-specific manner. Analysis of the relative importance of features in these models indicated that TFs, displaying larger HM pattern differences between BSs and non-BSs, bound DNA in an HM-specific manner on a protein family-specific basis. We propose that TF family-specific HM preferences reveal distinct mechanisms that assist in guiding TFs to their cognate BSs by altering chromatin structure and accessibility.},

BPAN is caused by mutations in an X-linked gene WDR45 that is involved in autophagy. BPAN is characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability until adolescence or early adulthood, followed by severe dystonia, parkinsonism, and progressive dementia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows iron deposition in the bilateral globus pallidus (GP) and sub-stantia nigra (SN). Clinical manifestations and laboratory find-ings in early childhood are limited. We report a 3-year-old girl with BPAN who presented with severe developmental delay and characteristic facial features. In addition to chronic elevation of serum aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor, she had persistent elevation of neuron specific enolase (NSE) in serum and cere-brospinal fluid. MRI using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) demonstrated iron accumulation in the GP and SN bilaterally. Targeted next-generation sequencing identified a de novo splice-site mutation, c.831-1G{\textgreater}C in WDR45, which resulted in aberrant splicing evidenced by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Persistent elevation of NSE and iron deposition on SWI may provide clues for diagnosis of BPAN in early childhood.},

Odds ratios (ORs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to assess the association. The results of the overall population had suggested that Int7G24A polymorphism had an increased risk for cancer, reaching significant levels in the 2 genetic models (allele model, OR = 1.25, 95{\%} CI 1.09-1.42, P = 0.001; dominant model, OR = 1.24, 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.46, P {\textless} 0.008). Besides, significant association was found among Asian population (allele model, OR = 1.27, 95{\%} CI 1.11-1.45, P {\textless} 0.001; dominant model, OR = 1.28, 95{\%} CI 1.11-1.49, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas there was non-significant relationship detected among Caucasian population (allele model, OR = 1.08, 95{\%} CI 0.92-1.26, P = 0.352; dominant model, OR = 1.05, 95{\%} CI 0.87-1.26, P = 0.639). The present meta-analysis had suggested that Int7G24A polymorphism of gene TGFBR1 involved in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-$\beta$) signaling pathway had a significantly increased risk for cancer development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNA-224 has been proven dysregulated in some human malignancies and correlated with tumor progression. However, its expression and clinical significance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of miR-224 in NSCLC tumorigenesis and development.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we detected miR-224 expression in NSCLC cell lines and primary tumor tissues. The association of miR-224 expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was also statistically analyzed. MTT, flow cytometric, Transwell invasion and migration assays, and scratch migration assay were used to test the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration of NSCLC cells after miR-224 mimics transfection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: MiR-224 expression levels were significantly down-regulated in NSCLC compared to the corresponding noncancerous lung tissues (P {\textless}0.001). In addition, decreased miR-224 expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002), advanced TNM stage (P {\textless}0.001), and shorter overall survival (P {\textless}0.001). Multivariate regression analysis corroborated that down-regulation of miR-224 was an independent unfavourable prognostic factor for patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, transfection of miR-224 mimics in NSCLC A549 cells was able to reduce cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, and promote cell apoptosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that miR-224 may act not only as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker, but also as a potential target for miR-based therapy of NSCLC.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nVIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/13000{\_}2014{\_}198.},

We identified increased expression of HMGA2 in the majority of primary human GBM tumors and cell lines compared to normal brain. Additionally, HMGA2 expression was increased in CD133+ GBM neurosphere cells compared to CD133- cells.

Canonical Wnt signaling contributes to Ras activity by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3)-dependent phosphorylation at the C-terminus and subsequent degradation. In the accompanying report, we show that the anti-helminthic niclosamide directly binds to GSK-3 and inhibits Axin functions in colon cancer cells, with reversion of Snail-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In this study, we report that niclosamide effectively suppresses Ras and nuclear NFAT activities regardless of the mutational status of Ras at nM levels. Mechanistically, niclosamide increased endogenous GSK-3 activity, shortening the half-life of mutant Ras. Further, niclosamide activates Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein, a downstream target of Snail repressor. Niclosamide treatment attenuates Ras-induced oncogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide a clinically available repositioned Ras inhibitor as well as a novel strategy for inhibiting the Ras via GSK-3.},

abstract = {Adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) provide the reservoir of regenerative cells to produce new adipocytes, although their identity in humans remains elusive. Using FACS analysis, gene expression profiling, and metabolic and proteomic analyses, we identified three APC subtypes in human white adipose tissues. The APC subtypes are molecularly distinct but possess similar proliferative and adipogenic capacities. Adipocytes derived from APCs with high CD34 expression exhibit exceedingly high rates of lipid flux compared with APCs with low or no CD34 expression, while adipocytes produced from CD34 − APCs display beige-like adipocyte properties and a unique endocrine profile. APCs were more abundant in gluteofemoral compared with abdominal subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues, and the distribution of APC subtypes varies between depots and in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneity of human white adipose tissue and a potential basis for dysregulated adipocyte function in type 2 diabetes. Raajendiran et al. report the identification of three adipocyte progenitor cell (APC) subtypes that reside in human adipose tissues. These APCs have distinct molecular phenotypes yet retain similar adipogenic potential. The APCs give rise to adipocytes with divergent metabolic and endocrine capacities and their distribution varies in type 2 diabetes patients.},

The majority of Cockayne syndrome cases contain mutations in the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler CSB; however, how CSB protects cells from oxidative stress remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that oxidative stress alters the genomic occupancy of the CSB protein and increases CSB occupancy at promoters. Additionally, we found that the long-range chromatin-structure regulator CTCF plays a pivotal role in regulating sites of genomic CSB occupancy upon oxidative stress. We show that CSB directly interacts with CTCF in vitro and that oxidative stress enhances the CSB-CTCF interaction in cells. Reciprocally, we demonstrate that CSB facilitates CTCF-DNA interactions in vitro and regulates CTCF-chromatin interactions in oxidatively stressed cells. Together, our results indicate that CSB and CTCF can regulate each other's chromatin association, thereby modulating chromatin structure and coordinating gene expression in response to oxidative stress.},

The identification of markers that can predict the potential for metastases will have a great effect in improving patient outcomes. In this study, we used differential proteomics with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling and LC-MS/MS analysis to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in metastatic and primary RCC. We identified 1256 non-redundant proteins, and 456 of these were quantified. Further analysis identified 29 proteins that were differentially expressed (12 overexpressed and 17 underexpressed) in metastatic and primary RCC. Dysregulated protein expressions of profilin-1 (Pfn1), 14–3-3 zeta/delta (14–3-3$\zeta$), and galectin-1 (Gal-1) were verified on two independent sets of tissues by means of Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the protein expression profile specific for metastatic RCC can distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive RCC. Pathway analysis showed that dysregulated proteins are involved in cellular processes related to tumor progression and metastasis. Furthermore, preliminary analysis using a small set of tumors showed that increased expression of Pfn1 is associated with poor outcome and is a potential prognostic marker in RCC. In addition, 14–3-3$\zeta$ and Gal-1 also showed higher expression in tumors with poor prognosis than in those with good prognosis. Dysregulated proteins in metastatic RCC represent potential prognostic markers for kidney cancer patients, and a greater understanding of their involved biological pathways can serve as the foundation of the development of novel targeted therapies for metastatic RCC. },

Although the topological organization of individual reactions into metabolic networks is well understood, the principles that govern their global functional use under different growth conditions raise many unanswered questions. By implementing a flux balance analysis of the metabolism of Escherichia coli strain MG1655, here we show that network use is highly uneven. Whereas most metabolic reactions have low fluxes, the overall activity of the metabolism is dominated by several reactions with very high fluxes. E. coli responds to changes in growth conditions by reorganizing the rates of selected fluxes predominantly within this high-flux backbone. This behaviour probably represents a universal feature of metabolic activity in all cells, with potential implications for metabolic engineering.},

abstract = {The Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) has been demonstrated to modulate different intracellular signaling pathways in cancers. Studies have shown that RKIP is frequently downregulated in cancers; therefore, attempts have been made to upregulate the expression of RKIP using natural and synthetic agents for the treatment of human malignancies. Moreover, various regulators such as specific proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are involved in the regulation of RKIP expression have also been identified. RKIP mechanistically modulates the apoptotic regulators of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) signaling. Because of its critical role in human cancers, RKIP has drawn much research attention, and our understanding is expanding rapidly. Here, we summarize some of the biological complexities of RKIP regulation. However, we restrict our discussion to selected tumors by focusing on TRAIL, miRNAs and natural agents. Emerging evidence suggests a role for natural agents in RKIP regulation in cancer cells; therefore, naturally occurring agents may serve as cancer-targeting agents for cancer treatment. Although the literature suggests some advancement in our knowledge of RKIP biology, it is incomplete with regard to its preclinical and clinical efficacy; thus, further research is warranted. Furthermore, the mechanism by which chemotherapeutic drugs and novel compounds modulate RKIP and how nanotechnologically delivered RKIP can be therapeutically exploited remain to be determined.},

Little is known about how T-tubules maintain highly organized structures and contacts throughout the contractile system despite the ongoing muscle remodeling that occurs with muscle atrophy, damage and aging. We uncovered an essential role for autophagy in T-tubule remodeling with genetic screens of a developmentally regulated remodeling program in Drosophila abdominal muscles. Here, we show that autophagy is both upregulated with and required for progression through T-tubule disassembly stages. Along with known mediators of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, our screens uncovered an unexpected shared role for Rab2 with a broadly conserved function in autophagic clearance. Rab2 localizes to autophagosomes and binds to HOPS complex members, suggesting a direct role in autophagosome tethering/fusion.

abstract = {Since the discovery of vitamin C, the number of its known biological functions is continually expanding. Both the names ascorbic acid and vitamin C reflect its antiscorbutic properties due to its role in the synthesis of collagen in connective tissues. Ascorbate acts as an electron-donor keeping iron in the ferrous state thereby maintaining the full activity of collagen hydroxylases; parallel reactions with a variety of dioxygenases affect the expression of a wide array of genes, for example via the HIF system, as well as via the epigenetic landscape of cells and tissues. In fact, all known physiological and biochemical functions of ascorbate are due to its action as an electron donor. The ability to donate one or two electrons makes AscH-an excellent reducing agent and antioxidant. Ascorbate readily undergoes pH-dependent autoxidation producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the presence of catalytic metals this oxidation is accelerated. In this review, we show that the chemical and biochemical nature of ascorbate contribute to its antioxidant as well as its prooxidant properties. Recent pharmacokinetic data indicate that intravenous (i.v.) administration of ascorbate bypasses the tight control of the gut producing highly elevated plasma levels; ascorbate at very high levels can act as prodrug to deliver a significant flux of H2O2to tumors. This new knowledge has rekindled interest and spurred new research into the clinical potential of pharmacological ascorbate. Knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms of action of pharmacological ascorbate bring a rationale to its use to treat disease especially the use of i.v. delivery of pharmacological ascorbate as an adjuvant in the treatment of cancer. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Autophagy and GRP78 overexpression are two important means by which tumor cells resist microenvironmental stress and chemotherapeutic drugs; however, the relationship between autophagy and GRP78 remains unclear. Here, we found that forced expression of GRP78 in tumor cells promoted autophagy, which was indicated by alterations in the levels of autophagy related proteins, such as increased VPS34 and LC3-II, and decreased p62 and LC3-I. Consistently, GRP78 knockdown suppressed tumor cell autophagy. Our results further demonstrated that GRP78-induced autophagy was mediated by VPS34, and that UPR-associated autophagy was also involved. GRP78-overexpressing cells treated with VPS34 siRNA reversed the autophagy induced by GRP78. Importantly, the expression of microRNA-143 (miR-143) was decreased in GRP78-overexpressing cells, and the increased expression of VPS34 was reversed by treatment with miR-143 mimic. This demonstrated that miR-143 plays a key role in GRP78's mediation of VPS34 expression. In addition, GRP78 acetylation was also involved in the occurrence of autophagy through upregulating VPS34. In turn, high expression of VPS34 promoted GRP78 transcription by modulating the GRP78 transcription factor ATF6. Moreover, VPS34 could enhance GRP78 protein stability by inhibiting GRP78 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Collectively, the results revealed a positive feedback loop between GRP78 and VPS34 in tumor cells that might be important for autophagy during tumor development.},

This knowledge can be used to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks. Such networks are usually represented as directed graphs where regulatory interactions are depicted as directed edges from the transcription factor nodes to the target gene nodes. This abstract representation allows us to apply graph theory to study transcriptional regulation at global and local levels, to predict regulatory motifs and regulatory modules such as regulons and to compare the regulatory network of different genomes.

We identified 3186 mostly novel interactions among 1705 proteins, resulting in a large, highly connected network. Independent pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays validated the overall quality of the Y2H interactions. Using topological and GO criteria, a scoring system was developed to define 911 high-confidence interactions among 401 proteins. Furthermore, the network was searched for interactions linking uncharacterized gene products and human disease proteins to regulatory cellular pathways. Two novel Axin-1 interactions were validated experimentally, characterizing ANP32A and CRMP1 as modulators of Wnt signaling. Systematic human protein interaction screens can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of protein function and cellular processes. Copyright {\textcopyright}2005 by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {“Master” transcription factors are the gatekeepers of lineage identity. As such, they have been a major focus of efforts to manipulate cell fate for therapeutic purposes. The ETS transcription factor PU.1 has a potent ability to confer macrophage phenotypes on cells already committed to a different lineage, but how it overcomes the presence of other master regulators is not known. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) is the master regulator of the adipose lineage, and its genomic binding pattern in adipocytes is well characterized. Here we show that, when expressed at macrophage levels in mature adipocytes, PU.1 bound a large fraction of its macrophage sites, where it induced chromatin opening and the expression of macrophage target genes. Strikingly, PU.1 markedly reduced the genomic binding of PPAR$\gamma$ without changing its abundance. PU.1 expression repressed genes with nearby adipocyte-specific PPAR$\gamma$ binding sites, while a common macrophage-adipocyte gene expression program was retained. Together, these data reveal unexpected lability within the adipocyte PPAR$\gamma$ cistrome and show that, even in terminally differentiated cells, PU.1 can remodel the cistrome of another master regulator.},

abstract = {Adipogenesis is a physiological process required for fat-tissue development, mainly involved in regulating the organism energetic-state. Abnormal distribution-changes and dysfunctions in such tissue are associated to different pathologies. Adipocytes are generated from progenitor cells, via a complex differentiating process not yet well understood. Therefore, we investigated differential mRNA and miRNA expression patterns of human mesenchymal stromal-cells (MSC) induced and not induced to differentiate into adipocytes by next (second)-generation sequencing. A total of 2,866 differentially expressed genes (101 encoding miRNA) were identified, with 705 (46 encoding miRNA) being upregulated in adipogenesis. They were related to different pathways, including PPARG, lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, redox, membrane-organelle biosynthesis, and endocrine system. Downregulated genes were related to extracellular matrix and cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Analyses of mRNA-miRNA interaction showed that repressed miRNA-encoding genes can act downregulating PPARG-related genes; mostly the PPARG activator (PPARGC1A). Induced miRNA-encoding genes regulate downregulated genes related to TGFB1. These results shed new light to understand adipose-tissue differentiation and physiology, increasing our knowledge about pathologies like obesity, type-2 diabetes and osteoporosis. J. Cell.

abstract = {In apparently scale-free protein-protein interaction networks, or 'interactome' networks, most proteins interact with few partners, whereas a small but significant proportion of proteins, the 'hubs', interact with many partners. Both biological and non-biological scale-free networks are particularly resistant to random node removal but are extremely sensitive to the targeted removal of hubs. A link between the potential scale-free topology of interactome networks and genetic robustness seems to exist, because knockouts of yeast genes encoding hubs are approximately threefold more likely to confer lethality than those of non-hubs. Here we investigate how hubs might contribute to robustness and other cellular properties for protein-protein interactions dynamically regulated both in time and in space. We uncovered two types of hub: 'party' hubs, which interact with most of their partners simultaneously, and 'date' hubs, which bind their different partners at different times or locations. Both in silico studies of network connectivity and genetic interactions described in vivo support a model of organized modularity in which date hubs organize the proteome, connecting biological processes--or modules--to each other, whereas party hubs function inside modules.},

Previously, we found that nicotine up-regulates peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), an important antioxidant enzyme, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF$\kappa$B) in OSCC cells. However, the molecular mechanism of Prx1 in oral carcinogenesis remains obscure. To improve our understanding of the functional role of Prx1 during the cascade of tobacco-associated oral carcinogenesis, we characterized Prx1, NF$\kappa$B, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers including E-cadherin, vimentin and Snail in 30 primary oral tumors (15 from smokers with OSCC and 15 from non-smokers with OSCC) and 10 normal oral mucosa specimens from healthy individuals. The expression levels of Prx1, nuclear NF$\kappa$B, vimentin and Snail were higher in the tumors from smokers with OSCC than in those from non-smokers with OSCC or the healthy controls. The expression levels of E-cadherin showed an opposite trend. Prx1 silencing suppressed the nicotine-induced EMT, cell invasion and migration in SCC15 cells in vitro. Furthermore, Prx1 activated the NF$\kappa$B pathway in SCC15 cells. Prx1 might therefore play an oncogenic role in tobacco-related OSCC and thus serve as a target for chemopreventive and therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Thirty-six percent of US adults are obese, and many cannot lose sufficient weight to improve health with lifestyle interventions alone. OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review of medications currently approved in the United States for obesity treatment in adults. We also discuss off-label use of medications studied for obesity and provide considerations for obesity medication use in clinical practice. EVIDENCE REVIEW A PubMed search from inception through September 2013 was performed to find meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized, placebo-controlled trials for currently approved obesity medications lasting at least 1 year that had a primary or secondary outcome of body weight change, included at least 50 participants per group, reported at least 50{\%} retention, and reported results on an intention-to-treat basis. Studies of medications approved for other purposes but tested for obesity treatment were also reviewed. FINDINGS Obesity medications approved for long-term use, when prescribed with lifestyle interventions, produce additional weight loss relative to placebo ranging from approximately 3{\%} of initial weight for orlistat and lorcaserin to 9{\%} for top-dose (15/92 mg) phentermine plus topiramate-extended release at 1 year. The proportion of patients achieving clinically meaningful (at least 5{\%}) weight loss ranges from 37{\%} to 47{\%} for lorcaserin, 35{\%} to 73{\%} for orlistat, and 67{\%} to 70{\%} for top-dose phentermine plus topiramate-extended release. All 3 medications produce greater improvements in many cardiometabolic risk factors than placebo, but no obesity medication has been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. Most prescriptions are for noradrenergic medications, despite their approval only for short-term use and limited data for their long-term safety and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Medications approved for long-term obesity treatment, when used as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention, lead to greater mean weight loss and an increased likelihood of achieving clinically meaningful 1-year weight loss relative to placebo. By discontinuing medication in patients who do not respond with weight loss of at least 5{\%}, clinicians can decrease their patients' exposure to the risks and costs of drug treatment when there is little prospect of long-term benefit.},

The raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis in several human neoplasms, however its role on cervical cancer is unclear. In the present study, 259 uterine cervix tissues, including cervicitis, cervical intraepithelial lesions and carcinomas, were analyzed for RKIP expression by immunohistochemistry. We found that RKIP expression was significantly decreased during malignant progression, being highly expressed in non-neoplastic tissues (54{\%} of the samples; 73/135), and expressed at low levels in the cervix invasive carcinomas (∼15{\%} (19/124). Following in vitro downregulation of RKIP, we observed a viability and proliferative advantage of RKIP-inhibited cells over time, which was associated with an altered cell cycle distribution and higher colony number in a colony formation assay. An in vitro wound healing assay showed that RKIP abrogation is associated with increased migratory capability. RKIP downregulation was also associated with an increased vascularization of the tumors in vivo using a CAM assay. Furthermore, RKIP inhibition induced cervical cancer cells apoptotic resistance to cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, we described that RKIP protein is significantly depleted during the malignant progression of cervical tumors. Despite the lack of association with patient clinical outcome, we demonstrate, in vitro and in vivo, that loss of RKIP expression can be one of the factors that are behind the aggressiveness, malignant progression and chemotherapy resistance of cervical cancer.},

abstract = {Despite 35 years of clinical trials, there is little improvement in 1-year survival rates for patients with metastatic melanoma, and the disease is essentially untreatable if not cured surgically. The paucity of chemotherapeutic agents that are effective for treating metastatic melanoma indicates a dire need to develop new therapies. Here, we found a previously unrecognized role for c-Abl and Arg in melanoma progression. We demonstrate that the kinase activities of c-Abl and Arg are elevated in primary melanomas (60{\%}), in a subset of benign nevi (33{\%}) and in some human melanoma cell lines. Using siRNA and pharmacological approaches, we show that c-Abl/Arg activation is functionally relevant because it is requiredfor melanoma cell proliferation, survival and invasion. Significantly, we identify the mechanism by which activated c-Abl promotes melanoma invasion by showing that it transcriptionally upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), and using rescue approaches we demonstrate that c-Abl promotes invasion through a STAT3 → MMP-1 pathway. Additionally, we show that c-Abl and Arg are not merely redundant, as active Arg drives invasion in a STAT3-independent manner, and upregulates MMP-3 and MT1-MMP, in addition to MMP-1. Most importantly, c-Abl and Arg not only promote in vitro processes important for melanoma progression, but also promote metastasis in vivo, as inhibition of c-Abl/Arg kinase activity with the c-Abl/Arg inhibitor, nilotinib, dramatically inhibits metastasis in a mouse model. Taken together, these data identify c-Abl and Arg as critical, novel, drug targets in metastatic melanoma, and indicate that nilotinib may be useful in preventing metastasis in patients with melanomas harboring active c-Abl and Arg.},

The mesenchymal phenotype observed in fibroblasts is specifically important based on the expression of smooth muscle actin (-SMA), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP1), and collagen to enhance EMT. Although EMT is not completely dependent on EMT regulators such as Snail, Twist, and Zeb-1/-2, analysis of upstream signaling (i.e., TGF-, EGF, Wnt) is necessary to understand tumor EMT more comprehensively. Tumor epithelial–fibroblast interactions that regulate tumor progression have been identified during prostate cancer. The cellular crosstalk is significant because these events influence therapy response and patient outcome. This review addresses how canonical EMT signals originating from prostate cancer fibroblasts contribute to tumor metastasis and recurrence after therapy.},

abstract = {Therapeutic resistance remains the most challenging aspect of treating cancer. Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) emerged as a molecule capable of sensitizing cancerous cells to radio- and chemotherapy. Moreover, this small evolutionary conserved molecule, endows significant resistance to cancer therapy when its expression is reduced or lost. RKIP has been shown to inhibit the Raf-MEK-ERK, NF$\kappa$B, GRK and activate the GSK3$\beta$ signaling pathways. Inhibition of Raf-MEK-ERK and NF$\kappa$B remains the most prominent pathways implicated in the sensitization of cells to therapeutic drugs. Our purpose was to identify a possible link between RKIP-KEAP 1-NRF2 and drug resistance. To that end, RKIP-KEAP 1 association was tested in human colorectal cancer tissues using immunohistochemistry. RKIP miRNA silencing and its inducible overexpression were employed in HEK-293 immortalized cells, HT29 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines to further investigate our aim. We show that RKIP enhanced Kelch-like ECH-associated protein1 (KEAP 1) stability in colorectal cancer tissues and HT29 CRC cell line. RKIP silencing in immortalized HEK-293 cells (termed HEK-499) correlated significantly with KEAP 1 protein degradation and subsequent NRF2 addiction in these cells. Moreover, RKIP depletion in HEK-499, compared to control cells, bestowed resistance to supra physiological levels of H(2)O(2) and Cisplatin possibly by upregulating NF-E2-related nuclear factor 2 (NRF2) responsive genes. Similarly, we observed a direct correlation between the extent of apoptosis, after treatment with Adriamycin, and the expression levels of RKIP/KEAP 1 in HT29 but not in HCT116 CRC cells. Our data illuminate, for the first time, the NRF2-KEAP 1 pathway as a possible target for personalized therapeutic intervention in RKIP depleted cancers.},

BPAN mainly affects females and is characterized by seizures and developmental delay or intellectual disability until adolescence or early adulthood, followed by severe dystonia, parkinsonism, and progressive dementia. However, rare male patients have recently been reported with hemizygous germline mutations in WDR45 and severe clinical manifestations, such as epileptic encephalopathies. We report here a 4-year-old boy presenting with profound developmental delay, non-syndromic epileptic encephalopathy, and early brain atrophy. The level of serum neuron specific enolase (NSE) was elevated, but the level of serum phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain was not detectable. Targeted next-generation sequencing identified a de novo hemizygous splice donor site mutation, c.830+1G {\textgreater} A in WDR45, which resulted in a splicing defect evidenced by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Mutations in WDR45 should be considered as a cause for epileptic encephalopathies in males with profound developmental delay and brain atrophy. Furthermore, elevation of serum NSE may contribute to early diagnosis of BPAN.},

Macrophages are one of the most thoroughly studied pleiotropic cells of the immune system. One of their major cytophysiological functions is their involvement in phagocytosis. Previous studies examining the microenvironment of melanomas and tumor-associated macrophages have revealed that they are involved in all stages of melanomagenesis. In the case of cancer initiation, they form an inflammatory microenvironment and then suppress the anticancer activity of the immune system, stimulate angiogenesis, enhance migration and invasion of the cancer cells, and ultimately contribute to the metastatic process. The present review provides a detailed overview on the function of macrophages in the melanoma microenvironment.},

Our previous study has found that Tollip inhibited NF-$\kappa$B-dependent HIV-1 promoter LTR-driven transcription, indicating the potential role of Tollip in governing viral latency. In this study, by using HIV-1 latently infected Jurkat T-cell and central memory CD4+T-cells, we demonstrate the role of Tollip in regulating HIV-1 latency, as the knock-down of Tollip promoted HIV-1 reactivation from both HIV-1 latently infected Jurkat CD4+T cells and primary central memory T cells (TCM). Moreover, we found that the activities of LTRs derived from multiple HIV-1 subtypes could be repressed by Tollip; Knock-down of Tollip promoted HIV-1 transcription and infection in CD4+T cells. Our data indicate a key role of Tollip in suppressing HIV-1 infection and regulating viral latency, which provides a potential host target for combating HIV-1 infection and latency.},

abstract = {A precise balance between protein degradation and synthesis is essential to preserve skeletal muscle mass. Here, we found that TP53INP2, a homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster DOR protein that regulates autophagy in cellular models, has a direct impact on skeletal muscle mass in vivo. Using different transgenic mouse models, we demonstrated that muscle-specific overexpression of Tp53inp2 reduced muscle mass, while deletion of Tp53inp2 resulted in muscle hypertrophy. TP53INP2 activated basal autophagy in skeletal muscle and sustained p62-independent autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Animals with muscle-specific overexpression of Tp53inp2 exhibited enhanced muscle wasting in streptozotocin-induced diabetes that was dependent on autophagy; however, TP53INP2 ablation mitigated experimental diabetes-associated muscle loss. The overexpression or absence of TP53INP2 did not affect muscle wasting in response to denervation, a condition in which autophagy is blocked, further indicating that TP53INP2 alters muscle mass by activating autophagy. Moreover, TP53INP2 expression was markedly repressed in muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes and in murine models of diabetes. Our results indicate that TP53INP2 negatively regulates skeletal muscle mass through activation of autophagy. Furthermore, we propose that TP53INP2 repression is part of an adaptive mechanism aimed at preserving muscle mass under conditions in which insulin action is deficient.},

Whereas post-translational modifications have emerged as an important mechanism to regulate transcriptional coregulator activity, the identification of the corresponding demodifying enzymes has remained elusive. Here we show that the expression of the Tip60 protein, which is essential for adipocyte differentiation, is regulated through polyubiquitination on multiple residues. USP7, a dominant deubiquitinating enzyme in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and mouse adipose tissue, deubiquitinates Tip60 both in intact cells and in vitro and increases Tip60 protein levels. Furthermore, inhibition of USP7 expression and activity decreases adipogenesis. Transcriptome analysis reveals several cell cycle genes to be co-regulated by both Tip60 and USP7. Knockdown of either factor results in impaired mitotic clonal expansion, an early step in adipogenesis. These results reveal deubiquitination of a transcriptional coregulator to be a key mechanism in the regulation of early adipogenesis.},

abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have the highest risk of recurrence and metastasis. Because they cannot be treated with targeted therapies, and many do not respond to chemotherapy, they represent a clinically underserved group. TNBC is characterized by reduced expression of metastasis suppressors such as Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), which inhibits tumor invasiveness. Mechanisms by which metastasis suppressors alter tumor cells are well characterized; however, their ability to regulate the tumor microenvironment and the importance of such regulation to metastasis suppression are incompletely understood. Here, we use species-specific RNA sequencing to show that RKIP expression in tumors markedly reduces the number and metastatic potential of infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). TAMs isolated from nonmetastatic RKIP(+) tumors, relative to metastatic RKIP(-) tumors, exhibit a reduced ability to drive tumor cell invasion and decreased secretion of prometastatic factors, including PRGN, and shed TNFR2. RKIP regulates TAM recruitment by blocking HMGA2, resulting in reduced expression of numerous macrophage chemotactic factors, including CCL5. CCL5 overexpression in RKIP(+) tumors restores recruitment of prometastatic TAMs and intravasation, whereas treatment with the CCL5 receptor antagonist Maraviroc reduces TAM infiltration. These results highlight the importance of RKIP as a regulator of TAM recruitment through chemokines such as CCL5. The clinical significance of these interactions is underscored by our demonstration that a signature comprised of RKIP signaling and prometastatic TAM factors strikingly separates TNBC patients based on survival outcome. Collectively, our findings identify TAMs as a previously unsuspected mechanism by which the metastasis-suppressor RKIP regulates tumor invasiveness, and further suggest that TNBC patients with decreased RKIP activity and increased TAM infiltration may respond to macrophage-based therapeutics.

Here we asked what cell-type-specific biologies might be supported by the selective expression of RUNX paralogs during Langerhans cell and inducible regulatory T cell differentiation. We uncovered functional nonequivalence between RUNX paralogs. Selective expression of native paralogs allowed integration of transcription factor activity with extrinsic signals, while non-native paralogs enforced differentiation even in the absence of exogenous inducers. DNA binding affinity was controlled by divergent amino acids within the otherwise highly conserved RUNT domain and evolutionary reconstruction suggested convergence of RUNT domain residues toward submaximal strength. Hence, the selective expression of gene duplicates in specialized cell types can synergize with the acquisition of functional differences to enable appropriate gene expression, lineage choice and differentiation in the mammalian immune system.},

abstract = {Snail1 is the founding member of the Snail superfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors, which also includes Snail2 (Slug) and Snail3 (Smuc). The superfamily is involved in cell differentiation and survival, two processes central in cancer research. Encoded by the SNAI1 gene located on human chromosome 20q13.2, Snail1 is composed of 264 amino acids and usually acts as a transcriptional repressor. Phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Snail1, governed by PI3K and Wnt signaling pathways crosstalk, are critical in Snail1's regulation. Snail1 has a pivotal role in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the process by which epithelial cells acquire a migratory, mesenchymal phenotype, as a result of its repression of E-cadherin. Snail1-induced EMT involves the loss of E-cadherin and claudins with concomitant upregulation of vimentin and fibronectin, among other biomarkers. While essential to normal developmental processes such as gastrulation, EMT is associated with metastasis, the cancer stem cell phenotype, and the regulation of chemo and immune resistance in cancer. Snail1 expression is a common sign of poor prognosis in metastatic cancer, and tumors with elevated Snail1 expression are disproportionately difficult to eradicate by current therapeutic treatments. The significance of Snail1 as a prognostic indicator, its involvement in the regulation of EMT and metastasis, and its roles in both drug and immune resistance point out that Snail1 is an attractive target for tumor growth inhibition and a target for sensitization to cytotoxic drugs.},

abstract = {Patient-derived human-in-mouse xenograft models of breast cancer (PDX models) that exhibit spontaneous lung metastases offer a potentially powerful model of cancer metastasis. In this study, we evaluated the malignant character of lung micrometastases that emerge in such models after orthotopic implantation of human breast tumor cells into the mouse mammary fat pad. Interestingly, relative to the parental primary breast tumors, the lung metastasis (met)-derived mammary tumors exhibited a slower growth rate and a reduced metastatic potential with a more differentiated epithelial status. Epigenetic correlates were determined by gene array analyses. Lung met-derived tumors displayed differential expression of negative regulators of cell proliferation and metabolism and positive regulators of mammary epithelial differentiation. Clinically, this signature correlated with breast tumor subtypes. We identified hsa-miR-138 (miR-138) as a novel regulator of invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells, acting by directly targeting the polycomb epigenetic regulator EZH2. Mechanistic investigations showed that GATA3 transcriptionally controlled miR-138 levels in lung metastases. Notably, the miR-138 activity signature served as a novel independent prognostic marker for patient survival beyond traditional pathologic variables, intrinsic subtypes, or a proliferation gene signature. Our results highlight the loss of malignant character in some lung micrometastatic lesions and the epigenetic regulation of this phenotype.},

KLF1, the founding member of the family, has been implicated in the control of both erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Here we describe a novel system using an artificial dominant negative isoform of KLF1 to investigate the role of KLF1 in the erythroid/megakaryocytic switch in vivo. We developed murine cell lines stably overexpressing a GST-KLF1 DNA binding domain fusion protein (GST-KLF1 DBD), as well as lines expressing GST only as a control. Interestingly, overexpression of GST-KLF1 DBD led to an overall reduction in erythroid features and an increase in megakaryocytic features indicative of a reduced function of endogenous KLF1. We simultaneously compared in vivo DNA occupancy of both endogenous KLF1 and GST-KLF1 DBD by ChIP qPCR. Here we found that GST-KLF1 DBD physically displaces endogenous KLF1 at a number of loci, providing novel in vivo evidence of direct competition between DNA binding proteins. These results highlight the role of KLF1 in the erythroid/megakaryocyte switch and suggest that direct competition between transcription factors with similar consensus sequences is an important mechanism in transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

This study explored abnormal expression of Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in cervical cancer and its correlation with the expression of E-cadherin and human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6. YY1, E-cadherin and HPV16 E6 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry in 90 cervical tissue specimens collected from 30 patients with hysteromyoma, 15 patients with CIN I, 15 patients with CIN II-III, and 30 patients with CSCC. The H-score method was employed to measure the expression of YY1, E-cadherin and HPV16 E6. Increased expression of YY1 and HPV16 E6, and the decreased expression levels of E-cadherin were strongly associated with malignant transformation of the cervical epithelium and the histological progression of CSCC. The expression of YY1 in cervical tissues was inversely correlated with E-cadherin expression, and positively correlated with HPV16 E6 expression. Expression of YY1 in CSCC tissues was not significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, but was significantly correlated with an advanced clinical stage of CSCC. These results suggest that up-regulation of YY1 is closely associated with the progression of CSCC, and YY1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer by modulating the expression of E-cadherin and HPV16 E6.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent work has revealed that autophagy plays a significant role in the process of white adipocyte differentiation. In both in vitro and in vivo model systems, autophagy inactivation by targeted deletion of essential autophagy genes results in alterations in white adipocyte structure. In both models, postdifferentiation cells exhibit atypical morphology, with many small lipid droplets and large numbers of mitochondria, rather than the single large lipid droplet and relatively few mitochondria observed in normal white adipocytes. The role of autophagy as the primary means of the degradation of mitochondria has long been studied, and it is likely that a deficiency in the degradation of mitochondria contributes to the unusual phenotypes observed in mice with autophagy-deficient adipose tissue, including reduced adiposity, resistance to diet-induced obesity, and increased insulin sensitivity. What is not yet known is whether the process of mitochondria-specific autophagy, often referred to as "mitophagy," is specifically induced during adipogenesis or if a general increase in the nonspecific autophagic degradation of mitochondria plays a role in normal adipose differentiation. Despite remaining questions, these findings not only establish the critical role of autophagy in white adipose tissue development, but also suggest that the manipulation of autophagy in adipose tissue may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for metabolic diseases.

Activity of FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling, but not that of MEK/ERK signaling, was decreased in Dtx3l/DTX3L-depleted murine and human melanoma cells. In summary, we demonstrated not only increased DTX3L level in melanoma cells but also DTX3L-mediated regulation of invasion and metastasis in melanoma through FAK/PI3K/AKT but not MEK/ERK signaling. Our analysis in human BRAFV600E inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells showed about 80{\%} decreased invasion in the DTX3L-depleted cells compared to that in the DTX3L-intact cells.

We performed comparative high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) in four mammals and characterized the conservation and divergence of chromosomal contact insulation and the resulting domain architectures within distantly related genomes. We show that the modular organization of chromosomes is robustly conserved in syntenic regions and that this is compatible with conservation of the binding landscape of the insulator protein CTCF. Specifically, conserved CTCF sites are co-localized with cohesin, are enriched at strong topological domain borders, and bind to DNA motifs with orientations that define the directionality of CTCF's long-range interactions. Conversely, divergent CTCF binding between species is correlated with divergence of internal domain structure, likely driven by local CTCF binding sequence changes, demonstrating how genome evolution can be linked to a continuous flux of local conformation changes. We also show that large-scale domains are reorganized during genome evolution as intact modules.},

NFIA and the master transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis, PPAR$\gamma$, co-localize at the brown-fat-specific enhancers. Moreover, the binding of NFIA precedes and facilitates the binding of PPAR$\gamma$, leading to increased chromatin accessibility and active transcription. Introduction of NFIA into myoblasts results in brown adipocyte differentiation. Conversely, the brown fat of NFIA-knockout mice displays impaired expression of the brown-fat-specific genes and reciprocal elevation of muscle genes. Finally, expression of NFIA and the brown-fat-specific genes is positively correlated in human brown fat. These results indicate that NFIA activates the cell-type-specific enhancers and facilitates the binding of PPAR$\gamma$ to control the brown fat gene program.},

Suppression, by antisense technology, of this protein causes devastating effects on tumor cells viability, through a massive induction of apoptosis, while being non-toxic to non-transformed cells. To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic effects observed after CSB ablation, global gene expression patterns were determined, to identify genes that were significantly differentially regulated as a function of CSB expression. Our findings revealed that response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and response to unfolded proteins were ranked top amongst the cellular processes affected by CSB suppression. The major components of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis pathway, including pro-apoptotic factors downstream of the ATF3-CHOP cascade, were dramatically up-regulated. Altogether our findings add new pieces to the understanding of CSB mechanisms of action and to the molecular basis of CS syndrome.},

abstract = {Network Component Analysis (NCA) is a network structure-driven framework for deducing regulatory signal dynamics. In contrast to classical approaches such as principal component analysis or independent component analysis, NCA makes use of the connectivity structure from transcriptional regulatory networks to restrict the decomposition to a unique solution. However, the existing version of NCA cannot incorporate information beyond the network topology such as information obtained from regulatory gene knockouts that constrain the dynamics of regulatory signals. The ability of incorporating such information enables a more accurate and self-consistent analysis over different experiments and extends NCA to systems that may not satisfy the identifiability criteria of NCA. In this paper, we derive a generalized form of NCA, gNCA, which significantly expands the capability of transcription network analysis by incorporating regulatory signal constraints arising from genetic knockouts. The theoretical bases including criteria for uniqueness of solution and distinguishability between networks are derived. In addition, numerical techniques for robust decomposition are discussed. gNCA is then demonstrated using an Escherichia coli wild-type strain and an isogenic arcA deletion mutant during a carbon source transition. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential developmental program that becomes reactivated in adult tissues to promote the progression of cancer. EMT has been largely studied by examining the beginning epithelial state or the ending mesenchymal state without studying the intermediate stages. Recent studies using trophoblast stem (TS) cells paused in EMT have defined the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms responsible for modulating the intermediate "metastable" stages of EMT. Targeted inactivation of MAP3K4, knockdown of CBP, or overexpression of SNAI1 in TS cells induced similar metastable phenotypes. These TS cells exhibited epigenetic changes in the histone acetylation landscape that cause loss of epithelial maintenance while preserving self-renewal and multipotency. A similar phenotype was found in claudin-low breast cancer cells with properties of EMT and stemness. This intersection between EMT and stemness in TS cells and claudin-low metastatic breast cancer demonstrates the usefulness of developmental EMT systems to understand EMT in cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Dissecting the regulatory relationships between genes is a critical step towards building accurate predictive models of biological systems. A powerful approach towards this end is to systematically study the differences in correlation between gene pairs in more than one distinct condition. RESULTS In this study we develop an R package, DGCA (for Differential Gene Correlation Analysis), which offers a suite of tools for computing and analyzing differential correlations between gene pairs across multiple conditions. To minimize parametric assumptions, DGCA computes empirical p-values via permutation testing. To understand differential correlations at a systems level, DGCA performs higher-order analyses such as measuring the average difference in correlation and multiscale clustering analysis of differential correlation networks. Through a simulation study, we show that the straightforward z-score based method that DGCA employs significantly outperforms the existing alternative methods for calculating differential correlation. Application of DGCA to the TCGA RNA-seq data in breast cancer not only identifies key changes in the regulatory relationships between TP53 and PTEN and their target genes in the presence of inactivating mutations, but also reveals an immune-related differential correlation module that is specific to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). CONCLUSIONS DGCA is an R package for systematically assessing the difference in gene-gene regulatory relationships under different conditions. This user-friendly, effective, and comprehensive software tool will greatly facilitate the application of differential correlation analysis in many biological studies and thus will help identification of novel signaling pathways, biomarkers, and targets in complex biological systems and diseases.},

abstract = {The regulation of autophagy in metazoans is only partly understood, and there is a need to identify the proteins that control this process. The diabetes- and obesity-regulated gene (DOR), a recently reported nuclear cofactor of thyroid hormone receptors, is expressed abundantly in metabolically active tissues such as muscle. Here, we show that DOR shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, depending on cellular stress conditions, and re-localizes to autophagosomes on autophagy activation. We demonstrate that DOR interacts physically with autophagic proteins Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE16) and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies indicate that DOR stimulates autophagosome formation and accelerates the degradation of stable proteins. CG11347, the DOR Drosophila homologue, has been predicted to interact with the Drosophila Atg8 homologues, which suggests functional conservation in autophagy. Flies lacking CG11347 show reduced autophagy in the fat body during pupal development. All together, our data indicate that DOR regulates autophagosome formation and protein degradation in mammalian and Drosophila cells.},

Our results showed that miR-378a-3p and miR-378a-5p expression were dramatically lower in CRC cell lines and tissues than that in adjacent normal colorectal mucosal tissues, respectively. MiR-378a-3p and miR-378a-5p expression were significantly associated with histological differentiation and TNM stage, respectively. CRC patients with low miR-378a-3p and miR-378a-5p expression had a significantly shorter survival time than those patients with high miR-378a-3p and miR-378a-5p expression (p {\textless} 0.001, p {\textless} 0.001), respectively. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that tumour size, TNM stage, miR-378a-3p expression and miR-378a-5p expression were independent prognostic factors for CRC patients. Ectopic miR-378a-3p or miR-378a-5p expression inhibited cellular proliferation and colony formation, induced apoptosis and G1-phase cell cycle arrest in CRC cells, but had no effect on migration and invasion of CRC cells. Furthermore, miR-378a-3p over-expression or down-regulation could inhibit or enhance insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) expression in CRC cells. There was a significantly negative correlation between IGF1R protein expression and miR-378a-3p expression in CRC tissues. MiR-378a-3p over-expression or down-regulation suppressed or enhanced phosphorylated-ERK1/2 protein level, but had no effect on phosphorylated-Akt protein level. In conclusion, miR-378a-3p and miR-378a-5p expression might play an important role as tumour suppressor gene in the initial stage of carcinogenesis of CRC. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Evolution of gene regulation is crucial for our understanding of the phenotypic differences between species, populations and individuals. Sequence-specific binding of transcription factors to the regulatory regions on the DNA is a key regulatory mechanism that determines gene expression and hence heritable phenotypic variation. We use a biophysical model for directional selection on gene expression to estimate the rates of gain and loss of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in finite populations under both point and insertion/deletion mutations. Our results show that these rates are typically slow for a single TFBS in an isolated DNA region, unless the selection is extremely strong. These rates decrease drastically with increasing TFBS length or increasingly specific protein-DNA interactions, making the evolution of sites longer than ∼ 10 bp unlikely on typical eukaryotic speciation timescales. Similarly, evolution converges to the stationary distribution of binding sequences very slowly, making the equilibrium assumption questionable. The availability of longer regulatory sequences in which multiple binding sites can evolve simultaneously, the presence of “pre-sites” or partially decayed old sites in the initial sequence, and biophysical cooperativity between transcription factors, can all facilitate gain of TFBS and reconcile theoretical calculations with timescales inferred from comparative genomics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maspin, a putative tumor suppressor that is down-regulated in breast and prostate cancer, has been associated with decreased cell motility. Snail transcription factor is a zinc finger protein that is increased in breast cancer and is associated with increased tumor motility and invasion by induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Snail increases tumor motility and invasion utilizing prostate cancer cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Expression levels were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Cell motility and invasion assays were performed, while Snail regulation and binding to maspin promoter was analyzed by luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Snail protein expression was higher in different prostate cancer cells lines as compared to normal prostate epithelial cells, which correlated inversely with maspin expression. Snail overexpression in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells inhibited maspin expression and led to increased migration and invasion. Knockdown of Snail in DU145 and C4-2 cancer cells resulted in up-regulation of maspin expression, concomitant with decreased migration. Transfection of Snail into 22Rv1 or LNCaP cells inhibited maspin promoter activity, while stable knockdown of Snail in C4-2 cells increased promoter activity. ChIP analysis showed that Snail is recruited to the maspin promoter in 22Rv1 cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, this is the first report showing that Snail can negatively regulate maspin expression by directly repressing maspin promoter activity, leading to increased cell migration and invasion. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of Snail may be useful to re-induce expression of maspin tumor suppressor and prevent prostate cancer tumor progression.},

Yet, these microRNAs are mostly being studied and clinically trialed solely based on the understanding of their cell biologic effects, thus, neglecting the important immunologic effects that are sometimes opposite of the cell biologic effects. Here, we summarize both the cell biologic and immunologic effects of various microRNAs and discuss the importance of considering both effects before using them in clinical settings.

Although differences among organisms are often attributed to differential gene expression, genome-wide comparative analysis thus far has been based primarily on genomic sequence information. We present a comparative study of large datasets of expression profiles from six evolutionarily distant organisms: S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, E. coli, A. thaliana, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens. We use genomic sequence information to connect these data and compare global and modular properties of the transcription programs. Linking genes whose expression profiles are similar, we find that for all organisms the connectivity distribution follows a power-law, highly connected genes tend to be essential and conserved, and the expression program is highly modular. We reveal the modular structure by decomposing each set of expression data into coexpressed modules. Functionally related sets of genes are frequently coexpressed in multiple organisms. Yet their relative importance to the transcription program and their regulatory relationships vary among organisms. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining sequence and expression data for improving functional gene annotation and expanding our understanding of how gene expression and diversity evolved.},

We reported here a prevailing reduction of the raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) in ccRCC. In our examination of more than 600 ccRCC patients by western blot and immunohistochemistry, RKIP was significantly reduced in 80{\%} of tumors. Inhibition of RKIP transcription in ccRCC occurs to greater levels than VHL transcription based on the quantification analysis of their transcripts in six large datasets of DNA microarray available in Oncomine{\&}{\#}x2122; with the median rank of suppression being 582 and 2343 for RKIP and VHL, respectively. Collectively, the magnitude of RKIP reduction and the levels of its downregulation match those of VHL. Furthermore, RKIP displays tumor suppressing activity in ccRCC. While modulation of RKIP expression did not affect the proliferation of A498 and 786-0 ccRCC cells and neither their ability to form xenograft tumors in NOD/SCID mice, ectopic expression or knockdown of RKIP inhibited or enhanced A498 and 786-0 ccRCC cell invasion, respectively. This was associated with robust changes in vimentin expression, a marker of EMT. Taken together, we demonstrate here that downregulation of RKIP occurs frequently at a rate that reaches that of VHL, suggesting RKIP being a critical tumor suppressor for ccRCC. This is consistent with RKIP being a tumor suppressor for other cancers.},

The incidence of RKIP promoter methylation was significantly higher in tumor samples (75.3{\%}) than in the matched normal tissues (27.3{\%}; P{\textless}0.001). A higher incidence of promoter methylation was also detected in poorly differentiated cancers (93.5{\%}) compared with well-differentiated cancers (50.0{\%}; P{\textless}0.001), as well as in tumor samples with positive lymph node metastasis (86.7{\%}) compared with those with negative lymph node metastasis (59.4{\%}; P{\textless}0.001).

Here we show that JMJD1A is phosphorylated at S265 by protein kinase A (PKA), and this is pivotal to activate the $\beta$1-adrenergic receptor gene (Adrb1) and downstream targets including Ucp1 in brown adipocytes (BATs). Phosphorylation of JMJD1A by PKA increases its interaction with the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodelling complex and DNA-bound PPAR$\gamma$. This complex confers $\beta$-adrenergic-induced rapid JMJD1A recruitment to target sites and facilitates long-range chromatin interactions and target gene activation. This rapid gene induction is dependent on S265 phosphorylation but not on demethylation activity. Our results show that JMJD1A has two important roles in regulating hormone-stimulated chromatin dynamics that modulate thermogenesis in BATs. In one role, JMJD1A is recruited to target sites and functions as a cAMP-responsive scaffold that facilitates long-range chromatin interactions, and in the second role, JMJD1A demethylates H3K9 di-methylation.},

abstract = {Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection provokes an inflammation of the gastric mucosa, at high risk for ulcer and cancer development. The most virulent strains harbor the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI) encoding a type 4 secretion system, which allows delivery of bacterial effectors into gastric epithelial cells, inducing pro-inflammatory responses and phenotypic alterations reminiscent of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study characterizes EMT features in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells, and investigates their relationship with NF-kappaB activation. Cultured human gastric epithelial cell lines were challenged with a cagPAI+ H. pylori strain or cag isogenic mutants. Morphological changes, epithelial and mesenchymal gene expression and EMT-related microRNAs were studied. H. pylori up-regulates mesenchymal markers, including ZEB1. This transcription factor is prominently involved in the mesenchymal transition of infected cells and its up-regulation depends on cagPAI and NF-kappaB activation. ZEB1 expression and NF-kappaB activation were confirmed by immunohistochemistry in gastric mucosa from cagPAI+ H. pylori-infected patients. Gastric epithelial cell lines express high miR-200 levels, which are linked to ZEB1 in a reciprocal negative feedback loop and maintain their epithelial phenotype in non-infected conditions. However, miR-200b/c were increased upon infection, despite ZEB1 up-regulation and mesenchymal morphology. In the miR-200b-200a-429 cluster promoter, we identified a functional NF-kappaB binding site, recruiting NF-kappaB upon infection and trans-activating the microRNA cluster transcription. In conclusion, in gastric epithelial cells, cagPAI+ H. pylori activates NF-kappaB, which transactivates ZEB1, subsequently promoting mesenchymal transition. The unexpected N-FkappaB-dependent increase of miR-200 levels likely thwarts the irreversible loss of epithelial identity in that critical situation.},

abstract = {Summary The centrosome is the primary microtubule organizing center of the cells and templates the formation of cilia, thereby operating at a nexus of critical cellular functions. Here, we use proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to map the centrosome-cilium interface; with 58 bait proteins we generate a protein topology network comprising {\textgreater}7,000 interactions. Analysis of interaction profiles coupled with high resolution phenotypic profiling implicates a number of protein modules in centriole duplication, ciliogenesis, and centriolar satellite biogenesis and highlights extensive interplay between these processes. By monitoring dynamic changes in the centrosome-cilium protein interaction landscape during ciliogenesis, we also identify satellite proteins that support cilia formation. Systematic profiling of proximity interactions combined with functional analysis thus provides a rich resource for better understanding human centrosome and cilia biology. Similar strategies may be applied to other complex biological structures or pathways.},

abstract = {The cohesin protein complex holds sister chromatids in dividing cells together and is essential for chromosome segregation. Recently, cohesin has been implicated in mediating transcriptional insulation, via its interactions with CTCF. Here, we show in different cell types that cohesin functionally behaves as a tissue-specific transcriptional regulator, independent of CTCF binding. By performing matched genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-seq) in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), we discovered thousands of genomic sites that share cohesin and estrogen receptor alpha (ER) yet lack CTCF binding. By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, estrogen-regulated genes are preferentially bound by both ER and cohesin, and functionally, the silencing of cohesin caused aberrant re-entry of breast cancer cells into cell cycle after hormone treatment. We combined chromosomal interaction data in MCF-7 cells with our cohesin binding data to show that cohesin is highly enriched at ER-bound regions that capture inter-chromosomal loop anchors. Together, our data show that cohesin cobinds across the genome with transcription factors independently of CTCF, plays a functional role in estrogen-regulated transcription, and may help to mediate tissue-specific transcriptional responses via long-range chromosomal interactions.

abstract = {Recycling endosomes are generally thought to play a central role in endocytic recycling, but recent evidence has indicated that they also participate in other cellular events, including cytokinesis, autophagy, and neurite outgrowth. Rab small GTPases are key regulators in membrane trafficking, and although several Rab isoforms, e.g., Rab11, have been shown to regulate recycling endosomal trafficking, the precise mechanism by which these Rabs regulate recycling endosomes is not fully understood. In this study, we focused on a Rab-GTPase-activating protein (Rab-GAP), one of the key regulators of Rabs, and comprehensively screened 43 mammalian Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC)/Rab-GAP-domain-containing proteins (TBC proteins) for proteins that specifically localize on recycling endosomes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Four of the 43 mammalian TBC proteins screened, i.e., TBC1D11, TBC1D12, TBC1D14, and EVI5, were found to colocalize well with transferrin receptor, a well-known recycling endosome marker. We further investigated the biochemical properties of TBC1D12, a previously uncharacterized TBC protein. The results showed that TBC1D12 interacted with active Rab11 through its middle region and that it did not display Rab11-GAP activity in vitro. The recycling endosomal localization of TBC1D12 was found to depend on the expression of Rab11. We also found that TBC1D12 expression had no effect on common Rab11-dependent cellular events, e.g., transferrin recycling, in MEFs and that it promoted neurite outgrowth, a specialized Rab11-dependent cellular event, of PC12 cells independently of its GAP activity. These findings indicated that TBC1D12 is a novel Rab11-binding protein that modulates neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a highly conserved self-digestion pathway involved in various physiological and pathophysiological processes. Recent studies have implicated a pivotal role of autophagy in adipocyte differentiation, but the molecular mechanism for its role and how it is regulated during this process are not clear. Here, we show that CCAAT /enhancer-binding protein $\beta$ (C/EBP$\beta$), an important adipogenic factor, is required for the activation of autophagy during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. An autophagy-related gene, Atg4b, is identified as a de novo target gene of C/EBP$\beta$ and is shown to play an important role in 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, autophagy is required for the degradation of Klf2 and Klf3, two negative regulators of adipocyte differentiation, which is mediated by the adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1. Importantly, the regulation of autophagy by C/EBP$\beta$ and the role of autophagy in Klf2/3 degradation and in adipogenesis are further confirmed in mouse models. Our data describe a novel function of C/EBP$\beta$ in regulating autophagy and reveal the mechanism of autophagy during adipocyte differentiation. These new insights into the molecular mechanism of adipose tissue development provide a functional pathway with therapeutic potential against obesity and its related metabolic disorders.},

The fate of a cell is determined by the balance between the processes of fission and fusion that constantly occur in the mitochondria of cells. We previously showed that overexpression of Mitofusin-2 can induce apoptosis in HCC cells by triggering an influx of Ca(2+) into the mitochondria from the ER. The function of Mitofusin-2 has been studied extensively, but the mechanism underlying the post-transcriptional regulation of Mitofusin-2 has not been elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to identify the mechanism of Mitofusin-2 regulation in HCC. We demonstrated that Mitofusin-2 is a direct target of miR-761, which was found to be upregulated in HCC tissues. Furthermore, a miR-761 inhibitor impaired mitochondrial function by upregulating Mitofusin-2 and effectively repressed tumor growth and metastasis both in vivo and in vitro. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism underlying Mitofusin-2 regulation and the potential role of miR-761 in HCC, making it a potential candidate for use in HCC therapy in the future.},

abstract = {Background: Chromosomal architecture, which is constituted by chromatin loops, plays an important role in cellular functions. Gene expression and cell identity can be regulated by the chromatin loop, which is formed by proximal or distal enhancers and promoters in linear DNA (1D). Enhancers and promoters are fundamental non-coding elements enriched with transcription factors (TFs) to form chromatin loops. However, the specific cooperation of TFs involved in forming chromatin loops is not fully understood. Results: Here, we proposed a method for investigating the cooperation of TFs in four cell lines by the integrative analysis of DNA sequences, ChIP-Seq and ChIA-PET data. Results demonstrate that the interaction of enhancers and promoters is a hierarchical and dynamic complex process with cooperative interactions of different TFs synergistically regulating gene expression and chromatin structure. The TF cooperation involved in maintaining and regulating the chromatin loop of cells can be regulated by epigenetic factors, such as other TFs and DNA methylation. Conclusions: Such cooperation among TFs provides the potential features that can affect chromatin's 3D architecture in cells. The regulation of chromatin 3D organization and gene expression is a complex process associated with the hierarchical and dynamic prosperities of TFs.},

abstract = {microRNAs are noncoding RNAs that are important for embryonic stem cell development and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Tumor cells hijack EMT and stemness to grow and metastasize to distant organs including bone. In the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells interact with the stromal fibroblasts at the primary and metastatic sites and this interaction leads to tumor growth, EMT, and bone metastasis. Tumor-stromal interactions are a dynamic process that involves both cell-cell communications and extracellular vesicles and soluble factors. Growing body of evidence suggests that microRNAs are part of the payload that comprises the extracellular vesicles. microRNAs induce reactive stroma and thus convert normal stroma into tumor-associated stroma to promote aggressive tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Landmark published studies demonstrate that expression of specific microRNAs of DLK1-DIO3 stem cell cluster correlates with patient survival in metastatic prostate cancer. Thus, microRNAs mediate tumor growth, EMT, and metastasis through cell intrinsic mechanisms and extracellular communications and could be novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in bone metastatic prostate cancer.},

A detected binding event may not be biologically relevant, or a known regulatory interaction might not be observed under the growth conditions tested so far. To correctly identify physical interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and genes and to determine their regulatory implications under various experimental conditions, we integrated ChIP-chip data with motif binding sites, nucleosome occupancy and mRNA expression datasets within a probabilistic framework. This framework was specifically tailored for the identification of functional and non-functional DNA binding events. Using this, we estimate that only 50{\%} of condition-specific protein-DNA binding in budding yeast is functional. We further investigated the molecular factors determining the functionality of protein-DNA interactions under diverse growth conditions. Our analysis suggests that the functionality of binding is highly condition-specific and highly dependent on the presence of specific cofactors. Hence, the joint analysis of both, functional and non-functional DNA binding, may lend important new insights into transcriptional regulation.},

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), synthetic ligands of PPAR$\gamma$, have been used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus for two decades. TZDs were expected to be amazing drugs not only for type 2 diabetes but also for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerotic vascular disease because they can reduce both insulin resistance and inflammation in experimental studies. However, serious unwanted effects pushed TZDs back to an optional second-tier drug for type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, PPAR$\gamma$ is still one of the most important targets for the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, and novel strategies to modulate PPAR$\gamma$ activity to enhance its beneficial effects and reduce unwanted adverse effects are anticipated. Recent studies showed that post-translational modification (PTM) of PPAR$\gamma$ regulates PPAR$\gamma$ activity or stability and may be a novel way to optimize PPAR$\gamma$ activity with reduced adverse effects.

We previously demonstrated that SPHK1 is overexpressed and associated with clinical stage, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis and poor prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the biological roles involving SPHK1 and its potential usefulness as a therapeutic target in NPC remain unknown. In this study, Blocking SPHK1 using siRNA or FTY720 (a SPHK1 inhibitor) significantly reduced proliferation and migration and increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NPC cells. FTY720 also decreased SPHK1 activity, and overexpressing SPHK1 abrogated the FTY720-induced effects on cell viability. In addition, FTY720 sensitized NPC cells to radiotherapy by inhibiting SPHK1 activity  in vitro  and  in vivo . Furthermore, high SPHK1 expression was associated with increased Ki-67 and p-Akt and decreased caspase-3 expression in human NPC specimens. These data suggest that SPHK1 might be a potential therapeutic target for NPC.},

It also represents a canonical learning problem and thus has attracted a lot of attention in both the informatics and the statistical learning literature. Numerous approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple clustering to rather involved dynamic Bayesian network modeling, as well as hybrid ones that combine a number of modeling steps, such as employing ordinary differential equations coupled with genome annotation. These approaches are tailored to the type of data being employed. Available data sources include static steady state data and time course data obtained either for wild type phenotypes or from perturbation experiments.This review focuses on the class of autoregressive models using time course data for inferring gene regulatory networks. The central themes of sparsity, stability and causality are discussed as well as the ability to integrate prior knowledge for successful use of these models for the learning task at hand. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

AMPK executes numerous cellular functions, some of which are often perceived at odds with each other. While AMPK is essential for embryonic growth and development, its full impact in adult tissues is revealed under stressful situations that organisms face in the real world. Conflicting reports about its cellular functions, particularly in cancer, are intriguing and a growing number of AMPK activators are being developed to treat human diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Whether these drugs will have only context-specific benefits or detrimental effects in the treatment of human cancer will be a subject of intense research. Here we review the current state of AMPK research with an emphasis on cancer and discuss the yet unresolved context-dependent functions of AMPK in human cancer.},

The data display sharp resolution of binding position [+/-50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical NRSF-binding motifs. These ChIPSeq data also have high sensitivity and specificity [ROC (receiver operator characteristic) area {\textgreater}/= 0.96] and statistical confidence (P {\textless}10(-4)), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions.

abstract = {Melanoma is a cutaneous neoplastic growth of melanocytes with great potential to invade and metastasize, especially when not treated early and effectively. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the process by which melanocytes lose their epithelial characteristics and acquire mesenchymal phenotypes. Mesenchymal protein expression increases the motility, invasiveness, and metastatic potential of melanoma. Many pathways play a role in promotion of mesenchymal protein expression including RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Wnt/$\beta$-catenin, and several others. Downstream effectors of these pathways induce expression of EMT transcription factors including Snail, Slug, Twist, and Zeb that promote repression of epithelial and induction of mesenchymal character. Emerging research has demonstrated that a variety of small molecule inhibitors as well as phytochemicals can influence the progression of EMT and may even reverse the process, inducing re-expression of epithelial markers. Phytochemicals are of particular interest as supplementary treatment options because of their relatively low toxicities and anti-EMT properties. Modulation of EMT signaling pathways using synthetic small molecules and phytochemicals is a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing the aggressive progression of metastatic melanoma. In this review, we discuss the emerging pathways and transcription factor targets that regulate EMT and evaluate potential synthetic small molecules and naturally occurring compounds that may reduce metastatic melanoma progression.},

Insulin regulates mTOR function through a recently described canonical signaling pathway, which is initiated by the activation of class 1 PI3K. However, how the amino acid input is integrated with that of the insulin signaling pathway is unclear. Here we used a number of molecular, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches to address this issue. Unexpectedly, we found that a major pathway by which amino acids control mTOR signaling is distinct from that of insulin and that, instead of signaling through components of the insulin/class 1 PI3K pathway, amino acids mediate mTOR activation by signaling through class 3 PI3K, hVps34.},

@article{Draaisma2015,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION Recent advances in molecular diagnostics allow diffuse gliomas to be classified based on their genetic changes into distinct prognostic subtypes. However, a systematic analysis of all molecular markers has thus far not been performed; most classification schemes use a predefined and select set of genes/molecular markers. Here, we have analysed the TCGA dataset (combined glioblastoma (GBM) and lower grade glioma (LGG) datasets) to identify all prognostic genetic markers in diffuse gliomas in order to generate a comprehensive classification scheme. RESULTS Of the molecular markers investigated (all genes mutated at a population frequency {\textgreater}1.7 {\%} and frequent chromosomal imbalances) in the entire glioma dataset, 57 were significantly associated with overall survival. Of these, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations are associated with lowest hazard ratio, which confirms IDH as the most important prognostic marker in diffuse gliomas. Subsequent subgroup analysis largely confirms many of the currently used molecular classification schemes for diffuse gliomas (ATRX or TP53 mutations, 1p19q codeletion). Our analysis also identified PI3-kinase mutations as markers of poor prognosis in IDH-mutated + ATRX/TP53 mutated diffuse gliomas, median survival 3.7 v. 6.3 years (P = 0.02, Hazard rate (HR) 2.93, 95 {\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.16 - 7.38). PI3-kinase mutations were also prognostic in two independent datasets. In our analysis, no additional molecular markers were identified that further refine the molecular classification of diffuse gliomas. Interestingly, these molecular classifiers do not fully explain the variability in survival observed for diffuse glioma patients. We demonstrate that tumor grade remains an important prognostic factor for overall survival in diffuse gliomas, even within molecular glioma subtypes. Tumor grade was correlated with the mutational load (the number of non-silent mutations) of the tumor: grade II diffuse gliomas harbour fewer genetic changes than grade III or IV, even within defined molecular subtypes (e.g. ATRX mutated diffuse gliomas). CONCLUSION We have identified PI3K mutations as novel prognostic markers in gliomas. We also demonstrate that the mutational load is associated with tumor grade. The increase in mutational load may partially explain the increased aggressiveness of higher grade diffuse gliomas when a subset of the affected genes actively contributes to gliomagenesis and/or progression.},

For a given a TF, TFcoop bases its prediction upon the binding affinity of the target TF as well as any other TF identified as cooperating with this TF. The set of cooperating TFs and the model parameters are learned from ChIP-seq data of the target TF. We used TFcoop to investigate the TF combinations involved in the binding of 106 different TFs on 41 different cell types and in four different regulatory regions: promoters of mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs, and enhancers. Our experiments show that the approach is accurate and outperforms simple PWM methods. Moreover, analysis of the learned models sheds light on important properties of TF combinations. First, for a given TF and region, we show that TF combinations governing the binding of the target TF are similar for the different cell-types. Second, for a given TF, we observe that TF combinations are different between promoters and enhancers, but similar for promoters of distinct gene classes (mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs). Analysis of the TFs cooperating with the different targets show over-representation of pioneer TFs and a clear preference for TFs with binding motif composition similar to that of the target. Lastly, our models accurately distinguish promoters into classes associated with specific biological processes.},

abstract = {Accumulated evidences have demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a critical link between inflammation and cancer. Multiple studies have indicated that persistent activation of STAT3 in epithelial/tumor cells in inflammation-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor signaling. In inflammatory response whereby interleukin (IL)-6 production is abundant, STAT3-mediated pathways were found to promote the activation of sphingosine kinases (SphK1 and SphK2) leading to the production of S1P. Reciprocally, S1P encourages the activation of STAT3 through a positive autocrine-loop signaling. The crosstalk between IL-6, STAT3 and sphingolipid regulated pathways may play an essential role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression in inflamed intestines. Therapeutics targeting both STAT3 and sphingolipid are therefore likely to contribute novel and more effective therapeutic strategies against inflammation-associated CRC.},

We performed a comprehensive analysis of secreted miRNA abundance in pazopanib treated/untreated synovial sarcoma cells from four different cell lines (SYO-1, HS-SYII, 1273/99, and YaFuSS) using microarray technology, and discovered miR-761 in EVs as a potential biomarker of pazopanib-resistance in synovial sarcoma. Furthermore, we showed that miR-761 putatively targeted three proteins, thyroid hormone receptor interactor 6 (TRIP6), lamin A/C (LMNA), and NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3). Knockdown of any of these proteins was shown in previous studies to confer increased resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Our findings provide new insight into the potential role of miR-761, an EV-secreted miRNA from synovial sarcoma cells, making it a potential candidate for use in sarcoma therapy in the future.},

abstract = {The incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer (PCa) are increasing, and PCa is almost the second‑leading cause of cancer‑associated mortality in men. During tumor progression, epithelial cells decrease the number of adhesion molecules, change their polarity and position, rearrange their cytoskeleton and increase their migratory and invasive capacities. These changes are known under the concept of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is characterized by an upregulation of certain transcription factors, including SNAIL1, which represses genes that are characteristic of an epithelial phenotype, including E‑cadherin, and indirectly increase the expression levels of genes, which are associated with the mesenchymal phenotype. It has been suggested that the transcription factor, SNAIL1, decreases the proliferation and increases the migratory and invasive capacities of PCa cell lines. The present study was performed using LNCaP and PC3 cell lines, in which the expression levels of SNAIL1 were increased or silenced through the use of lentiviral vectors. The expression levels of EMT markers were quantified using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. In addition, cell survival was analyzed using an MTS assay; cell proliferation was examined using an antibody targeting Ki‑67; migration on plates with 8 µm pores to allow the passage of cells; and invasiveness was analyzed using a membrane chamber covered in dried basement membrane matrix solution. The levels of apoptosis were determined using a Caspase 3/7 assay containing a substrate modified by caspases 3 and 7. The results demonstrated that the overexpression and silencing of SNAIL1 decreased cell proliferation and survival. However, the overexpression of SNAIL1 decreased apoptosis, compared with cells with the SNAIL1‑silenced cells, in which cell apoptosis increased. The migration and invasive capacities increased in the cells overexpressing SNAIL1, and decreased when SNAIL1 was silenced. In conclusion, PCa cells overexpressing SNAIL1 exhibited characteristics of an EMT phenotype, whereas the silencing of the SNAIL1 transcriptional repressor promoted an epithelial‑like phenotype, with decreased migration and invasion, characteristic of mesenchymal cells.},

Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is a regulator of MAPK and NF-$\kappa$B signaling cascades, which are both critical for production of the proinflammatory cytokines responsible for SIRS initiation. By testing a T cell-dependent mouse model of SIRS that utilizes staphylococcal enterotoxin A specific for V$\beta$3(+) T cells, we show that RKIP is necessary for the exaggerated production of IFN-$\gamma$ from SIRS splenocytes. This effect was not due to differences in T cell expansion, IL-10 production, or APC priming, but rather a cell-intrinsic defect lying downstream of the TCR in staphylococcal enterotoxin A-specific CD8(+) T cells. Importantly, mice lacking RKIP were still able to proliferate, survive, and contribute to cytokine production in response to pathogen associated molecular pattern-TLR-mediated stimuli, despite the TCR-dependent defects seen in our SIRS model. Finally, by blocking RKIP in wild-type SIRS splenocytes, the IFN-$\gamma$ response by CD8(+) V$\beta$3(+) T cells was significantly diminished. These data suggest that RKIP may be a potential therapeutic target in SIRS by curbing effector cytokine production from CD8(+) T cells during serial TCR triggering.},

abstract = {Correction of chromatic shift is necessary for precise registration of multicolor fluorescence images of biological specimens. New emerging technologies in fluorescence microscopy with increasing spatial resolution and penetration depth have prompted the need for more accurate methods to correct chromatic aberration. However, the amount of chromatic shift of the region of interest in biological samples often deviates from the theoretical prediction because of unknown dispersion in the biological samples. To measure and correct chromatic shift in biological samples, we developed a quadrisection phase correlation approach to computationally calculate translation, rotation, and magnification from reference images. Furthermore, to account for local chromatic shifts, images are split into smaller elements, for which the phase correlation between channels is measured individually and corrected accordingly. We implemented this method in an easy-to-use open-source software package, called Chromagnon, that is able to correct shifts with a 3D accuracy of approximately 15 nm. Applying this software, we quantified the level of uncertainty in chromatic shift correction, depending on the imaging modality used, and for different existing calibration methods, along with the proposed one. Finally, we provide guidelines to choose the optimal chromatic shift registration method for any given situation.},

abstract = {RAF kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is a seminal regulator of intracellular signaling and exhibits both antimetastatic and antitumorigenic properties. Decreased expression of RKIP has been described in several human malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). As the mechanisms leading to RKIP loss in AML are still unclear, we aimed to analyze the potential involvement of miRNAs within this study. miRNA microarray and qPCR data of more than 400 AML patient specimens revealed correlation between decreased expression of RKIP and increased expression of miR-23a, a member of the miR-23a/27a/24-2 cluster. In functional experiments, overex-pression of miR-23a decreased RKIP mRNA and protein expres-sion, whereas miR-23a inhibition caused the opposite effect. By using an RKIP 3 0 -untranslated region luciferase reporter construct with and without mutation or deletion of the puta-tive miR-23a–binding site, we could show that RKIP modula-tion by miR-23a is mediated via direct binding to this region. Importantly, miR-23a overexpression induced a significant increase of proliferation in hematopoietic cells. Simultaneous transfection of an RKIP expression construct lacking the miR-23a–binding sites reversed this phenotype, indicating that this effect is truly mediated via downregulation of RKIP. Finally, by analyzing more than 4,300 primary patient specimens via database retrieval from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we could highlight the importance of the miR-23a/RKIP axis in a broad range of human cancer entities. In conclusion, we have iden-tified miR-23a as a negative regulator of RKIP expression in AML and have provided data that suggest the importance of our observation beyond this tumor entity.

abstract = {AMPK is a highly conserved sensor of cellular energy status that is activated under conditions of low intracellular ATP. AMPK responds to energy stress by suppressing cell growth and biosynthetic processes, in part through its inhibition of the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR (mTORC1) pathway. AMPK phosphorylation of the TSC2 tumor suppressor contributes to suppression of mTORC1; however, TSC2-deficient cells remain responsive to energy stress. Using a proteomic and bioinformatics approach, we sought to identify additional substrates of AMPK that mediate its effects on growth control. We report here that AMPK directly phosphorylates the mTOR binding partner raptor on two well-conserved serine residues, and this phosphorylation induces 14-3-3 binding to raptor. The phosphorylation of raptor by AMPK is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 and cell-cycle arrest induced by energy stress. These findings uncover a conserved effector of AMPK that mediates its role as a metabolic checkpoint coordinating cell growth with energy status. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Here we report that 14-3-3$\zeta$-knockout mice are strikingly lean from birth with specific reductions in visceral fat depots. Conversely, transgenic 14-3-3$\zeta$ overexpression potentiates obesity, without exacerbating metabolic complications. Only the 14-3-3$\zeta$ isoform is essential for adipogenesis based on isoform-specific RNAi. Mechanistic studies show that 14-3-3$\zeta$ depletion promotes autophagy-dependent degradation of C/EBP-$\delta$, preventing induction of the master adipogenic factors, Ppar$\gamma$ and C/EBP-$\alpha$. Transcriptomic data indicate that 14-3-3$\zeta$ acts upstream of hedgehog signalling-dependent upregulation of Cdkn1b/p27(Kip1). Indeed, concomitant knockdown of p27(Kip1) or Gli3 rescues the early block in adipogenesis induced by 14-3-3$\zeta$ knockdown in vitro. Adipocyte precursors in 14-3-3$\zeta$KO embryos also appear to have greater Gli3 and p27(Kip1) abundance. Together, our in vivo and in vitro findings demonstrate that 14-3-3$\zeta$ is a critical upstream driver of adipogenesis.},

abstract = {The transcription factor glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a key mediator of stress response and a broad range of physiological processes. How can GR rapidly activate the expression of some genes while repress others, remains an open question due to the challenge to associate GR binding sites (GBSs) to their distant gene targets. Mapping the full 3D scope of GR-responsive promoters using high-resolution 4C-seq unravelled spatial separation between chromatin interaction networks of GR-activated and repressed genes. Analysing GR binding sites and other regulatory loci in their functional 3D context revealed that GR sequesters the co-activator Ep300 from active non-GBS enhancers in both activated and repressed gene compartments. While this is sufficient for rapid gene repression, gene activation is countered by productive recruitment of Ep300 to GBS. Importantly, in GR-activated compartments Klf4 binding at non-GBS regulatory elements cluster in 3D with GBS and antagonizes GR activation. In addition, we revealed ROR and Rev-erb transcription factors as novel co-regulators for GR-mediated gene expression.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The nearest shrunken centroids classifier has become a popular algorithm in tumor classification problems using gene expression microarray data. Feature selection is an embedded part of the method to select top-ranking genes based on a univariate distance statistic calculated for each gene individually. The univariate statistics summarize gene expression profiles outside of the gene co-regulation network context, leading to redundant information being included in the selection procedure. RESULTS: We propose an Eigengene-based Linear Discriminant Analysis (ELDA) to address gene selection in a multivariate framework. The algorithm uses a modified rotated Spectral Decomposition (SpD) technique to select 'hub' genes that associate with the most important eigenvectors. Using three benchmark cancer microarray datasets, we show that ELDA selects the most characteristic genes, leading to substantially smaller classifiers than the univariate feature selection based analogues. The resulting de-correlated expression profiles make the gene-wise independence assumption more realistic and applicable for the shrunken centroids classifier and other diagonal linear discriminant type of models. Our algorithm further incorporates a misclassification cost matrix, allowing differential penalization of one type of error over another. In the breast cancer data, we show false negative prognosis can be controlled via a cost-adjusted discriminant function. AVAILABILITY: R code for the ELDA algorithm is available from author upon request.},

abstract = {Importance Schizophrenia is associated with widespread cognitive impairments. Although cognitive deficits are one of the factors most strongly associated with functional outcome in schizophrenia, current treatment strategies largely fail to ameliorate these impairments. To develop more efficient treatment strategies in patients with schizophrenia, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of these cognitive deficits is needed. Accumulating evidence indicates that genetic risk of schizophrenia may contribute to cognitive dysfunction. Objective To identify genomic regions jointly influencing schizophrenia and the cognitive domains of reaction time and verbal-numerical reasoning, as well as general cognitive function, a phenotype that captures the shared variation in performance across cognitive domains. Design, Setting, and Participants Combining data from genome-wide association studies from multiple phenotypes using conditional false discovery rate analysis provides increased power to discover genetic variants and could elucidate shared molecular genetic mechanisms. Data from the following genome-wide association studies, published from July 24, 2014, to January 17, 2017, were combined: schizophrenia in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium cohort (n = 79 757 [cases, 34 486; controls, 45 271]); verbal-numerical reasoning (n = 36 035) and reaction time (n = 111 483) in the UK Biobank cohort; and general cognitive function in CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) (n = 53 949) and COGENT (Cognitive Genomics Consortium) (n = 27 888). Main Outcomes and Measures Genetic loci identified by conditional false discovery rate analysis. Brain messenger RNA expression and brain expression quantitative trait locus functionality were determined. Results Among the participants in the genome-wide association studies, 21 loci jointly influencing schizophrenia and cognitive traits were identified: 2 loci shared between schizophrenia and verbal-numerical reasoning, 6 loci shared between schizophrenia and reaction time, and 14 loci shared between schizophrenia and general cognitive function. One locus was shared between schizophrenia and 2 cognitive traits and represented the strongest shared signal detected (nearest geneTCF20; chromosome 22q13.2), and was shared between schizophrenia (zscore, 5.01;P = 5.53 × 10−7), general cognitive function (zscore, –4.43;P = 9.42 × 10−6), and verbal-numerical reasoning (zscore, –5.43;P = 5.64 × 10−8). For 18 loci, schizophrenia risk alleles were associated with poorer cognitive performance. The implicated genes are expressed in the developmental and adult human brain. Replicable expression quantitative trait locus functionality was identified for 4 loci in the adult human brain. Conclusions and Relevance The discovered loci improve the understanding of the common genetic basis underlying schizophrenia and cognitive function, suggesting novel molecular genetic mechanisms.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common malignant tumor in infancy and most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. With the improvement of diagnosis and treatment, the survival rate of patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk NB can reach up to 90{\%}. In contrast, for high-risk NBs, the long-term survival rate is still {\textless}40{\%} because of heterogeneity of this tumor. The pathogenesis of NB is still not explicit, therefore it is of great significance to explore the mechanism of NB tumorigenesis and discover new therapeutic targets for NB. Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), one of the polo-like kinase family members, is an important regulator of centriole replication. The aberrant expression of PLK4 was found in several cancers and a recent study has unraveled a novel function of PLK4 as a mediator of invasion and metastasis in Hela and U2OS cells. However, the function of PLK4 in NB development and progression remains to be elucidated. The study showed the expression level of PLK4 in NB tissues was remarkably upregulated and high expression of PLK4 was negatively correlated with clinical features and survival, which suggested that PLK4 could be a potential tumor-promoting factor of NB. Functional studies indicated downregulation of PLK4 suppressed migration and invasion and promoted apoptosis in NB cells. Further experiments showed that downregulation of PLK4 in NB cells inhibited EMT through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Animal experiments demonstrated that the downregulation of PLK4 in SK-N-BE(2) cells dramatically suppressed tumorigenesis and metastasis. PLK4 may be a promising therapeutic target for NB.},

We performed a time-resolved analysis of NGF-TrkA signaling in neuroblastoma cells using mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics. The combination of interactome, phosphoproteome, and proteome data provided temporal insights into the molecular events downstream of NGF binding to TrkA. We showed that upon NGF stimulation, TrkA recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b, which then becomes phosphorylated and ubiquitylated and decreases in abundance. We also found that recruitment of Cbl-b promotes TrkA ubiquitylation and degradation. Furthermore, the amount of phosphorylation of the kinase ERK and neurite outgrowth increased upon Cbl-b depletion in several neuroblastoma cell lines. Our findings suggest that Cbl-b limits NGF-TrkA signaling to control the length of neurites.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE High-mobility group protein 2 (HMGA2) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins play key roles in cancer progression and metastasis. However, the clinical significance of HMGA2 and its relationship with EMT markers in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is unclear. This study aimed to assess the clinicopathological significance and prognostic value of HMGA2, E-cadherin, and vimentin in NPC. METHODS Using immunohistochemistry, HMGA2, E-cadherin, and vimentin expression levels were evaluated in NPC (n=124) and non-tumoral inflammatory nasopharynx (n=20) tissues. The association of HMGA2 and EMT markers with clinicopathological characteristics and relationships between the protein levels and overall survival were analyzed. RESULTS Compared with non-tumorous tissues, HMGA2 and vimentin levels were markedly increased in NPC tissues, whereas decreased E-cadherin levels were observed (P{\textless}0.001). Moreover, HMGA2 expression was positively correlated with vimentin levels (r=0.431, P{\textless}0.001) and negatively correlated with E-cadherin amounts (r=-0.413, P{\textless}0.001) in NPC tissues. The expression of all three proteins correlated significantly with tumor N stage, TNM stage, and 2-year metastasis. Furthermore, significant correlations were found for T stage, N stage, TNM stage, HMGA2, E-cadherin, and vimentin (all P{\textless}0.013) with poor prognosis (univariate analysis). However, multivariate analyses showed that only HMGA2 (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.683, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.185-6.077, P=0.018) and N stage (HR: 7.892, 95{\%} CI: 2.731-22.807, P{\textless}0.001) were independent predictors of poor prognosis. CONCLUSION These results demonstrated that HMGA2, an independent prognostic factor, may promote NPC progression and metastasis, and is significantly associated with EMT proteins. Therefore, HMGA2 may be considered a potential therapeutic target in NPC.},

In addition to NBIA subtypes caused by mutations in PANK2 and PLA2G6, mutations in the C19orf12 gene were recently described as the third frequent cause of NBIA (called mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration, MPAN). Additionally, the X-linked gene WDR45 was found causative for a special subtype named static encephalopathy in childhood with neurodegeneration in adulthood (also called BPAN); however, analysis of this gene in a broader spectrum of NBIA has not been reported yet. Methods In a heterogeneous cohort of 69 patients with suspected NBIA that did not carry mutations in PANK2 and PLA2G6, the coding region of C19orf12 was evaluated by Sanger sequencing. The WDR45 gene was analyzed via high resolution melting and subsequent sequence analysis. Results Previously described homozygous C19orf12 mutations were found in 3/69 NBIA patients (4.3{\%}). Analysis of the WDR45 gene revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation in one female NBIA patient showing psychomotor retardation with secondary decline. Conclusions C19orf12 mutations were confirmed in our heterogeneous NBIA cohort, while WDR45 mutations appear to be restricted to the subtype showing encephalopathy in childhood with neurodegeneration in adulthood.},

abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes a rapid and often reversible modulation of phenotype by epithelial cells. EMT was originally defined in the context of developmental stages, including heart morphogenesis, mesoderm and neural crest formation. Epithelial cells loosen cell-cell adhesion structures throughout EMT. They modulate their polarity, cytoskeleton organization and typically express vimentin filaments and downregulate cytokeratins. They become isolated, mobile and resistant to anoikis. The EMT at least superficially resembles the evolution from normal to transformed cell phenotype during carcinoma progression. The relevance of the concept of EMT in this context was indicated by in vitro models using transformed epithelial cells. Transduction pathways typical of embryogenic EMT in vivo were also found to be activated during cancer progression. More recently, it has been found that such pathways indicate an increased plasticity linked to cellular stemness and ability to generate tumors. However, in the absence of direct evidence, a number of oncologists and pathologists remain skeptical about applying the EMT concept to human tumor progression. Typically in the cancer field, EMT concept appears to be fully relevant in some situations, but the concept has to be adjusted in other situations to reflect tumor cell renewal and plasticity during carcinoma progression and metastasis.},

abstract = {Gene expression levels are thought to diverge primarily via regulatory mutations in trans within species, and in cis between species. To test this hypothesis in mammals we used RNA-sequencing to measure gene expression divergence between C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ mouse strains and allele-specific expression in their F1 progeny. We identified 535 genes with parent-of-origin specific expression patterns, although few of these showed full allelic silencing. This suggests that the number of imprinted genes in a typical mouse somatic tissue is relatively small. In the set of nonimprinted genes, 32{\%} showed evidence of divergent expression between the two strains. Of these, 2{\%} could be attributed purely to variants acting in trans, while 43{\%} were attributable only to variants acting in cis. The genes with expression divergence driven by changes in trans showed significantly higher sequence constraint than genes where the divergence was explained by variants acting in cis. The remaining genes with divergent patterns of expression (55{\%}) were regulated by a combination of variants acting in cis and variants acting in trans. Intriguingly, the changes in expression induced by the cis and trans variants were in opposite directions more frequently than expected by chance, implying that compensatory regulation to stabilize gene expression levels is widespread. We propose that expression levels of genes regulated by this mechanism are fine-tuned by cis variants that arise following regulatory changes in trans, suggesting that many cis variants are not the primary targets of natural selection. {\textcopyright} 2012, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Sustained activation of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) results in endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis and atherosclerosis development. The present study provides evidence that XBP1 mRNA splicing triggered an autophagic response in ECs by inducing autophagic vesicle formation and markers of autophagy BECLIN-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3$\beta$ (LC3-$\beta$II). Endostatin activated autophagic gene expression through XBP1 mRNA splicing in an inositol-requiring enzyme 1$\alpha$ (IRE1$\alpha$)-dependent manner. Knockdown of XBP1 or IRE1$\alpha$ by shRNA in ECs ablated endostatin-induced autophagosome formation. Importantly, data from arterial vessels from XBP1 EC conditional knock-out (XBP1eko) mice demonstrated that XBP1 deficiency in ECs reduced the basal level of LC3$\beta$ expression and ablated response to endostatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further revealed that the spliced XBP1 isoform bound directly to the BECLIN-1 promoter at the region from nt -537 to -755. BECLIN-1 deficiency in ECs abolished the XBP1-induced autophagy response, whereas spliced XBP1 did not induce transcriptional activation of a truncated BECLIN-1 promoter. These results suggest that XBP1 mRNA splicing triggers an autophagic signal pathway through transcriptional regulation of BECLIN-1.},

abstract = {Autophagy is prevalent in eukaryotic organisms. Massive research efforts have focused on the mechanism and functionality of autophagy in eukaryotes, for example, their role in human diseases. However, little is known about how this fundamental pathway evolved; in particular, there is an absence of research in prokaryotes. Here, we carried out a comparative genomics analysis among 84 species ranging from eukaryotes to eubacteria and archaebacteria. We found that most of the core proteins in the autophagy pathway were ubiquitous in eukaryotes, whereas the distribution of proteins involved in selective autophagy were limited. In prokaryotes, distant homologs of autophagy-related proteins were also found. Species in Cyanobacteria and Euryarchaeota possess relatively more of these homologs compared to other prokaryotes, which indicated the prokaryotic origin of some autophagy-related proteins. Phylogenic tree analysis and the distribution of homologs suggested that the presence of proteins involved in autophagosome formation should be an important sign of autophagy. Furthermore, we found that distribution of mitochondrial protein importing-related proteins was quite similar to that of autophagy-related proteins in eukaryotes and that their phylogenic profile was closer to that of several core autophagy proteins compared with 16S/18S ribosomal RNAs, suggesting the engulfment of mitochondria may be the driving force for the evolution of autophagy. Autophagy may have evolved as a quality control system for mitochondria at the very beginning of evolution of eukaryotes. This research shed light on the prokaryotic origin of autophagy and provided a new perspective that mitochondria and autophagy may interplay during the course of eukaryotic evolution.},

Classical symptoms of CS patients include failure to thrive and a severe neuropathology characterized by microcephaly, hypomyelination, calcification and neuronal loss. Modeling the neurological aspect of this disease has proven difficult since murine models fail to mirror classical neurological symptoms. Therefore, a robust human in vitro cellular model would advance our fundamental understanding of the disease and reveal potential therapeutic targets. Herein, we successfully derived functional CS neural networks from human CS induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) providing a new tool to facilitate studying this devastating disease. We identified dysregulation of the Growth Hormone/Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) pathway as well as pathways related to synapse formation, maintenance and neuronal differentiation in CSB neurons using unbiased RNA-seq gene expression analyses. Moreover, when compared to unaffected controls, CSB-deficient neural networks displayed altered electrophysiological activity, including decreased synchrony, and reduced synapse density. Collectively, our work reveals that CSB is required for normal neuronal function and we have established an alternative to previously available models to further study neural-specific aspects of CS.},

The advanced understanding of host-microbe interactions has largely been due to new technologies such as 16S rRNA sequencing to identify previously unknown microbial communities and, more importantly, their functional characteristics through metagenomic sequencing and other multi-omic technologies, such as metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics. Given the vast array of newly acquired knowledge in the field and technological advances, it is expected that mechanisms underlying several disease states involving the interactions between microbes, their metabolites, and the host will be discovered. The identification of these mechanisms will allow for the development of more precise therapies to prevent or manage chronic disease. This review discusses the functional characterization of the microbiome, highlighting the advances in identifying bioactive microbial metabolites that have been directly linked to gastrointestinal and peripheral diseases.},

abstract = {The advent of high-throughput genomics techniques, along with the completion of genome sequencing projects, identification of protein-protein interactions and reconstruction of genome-scale pathways, has accelerated the development of systems biology research in the yeast organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, discovery of biological pathways in yeast has become an important forefront in systems biology, which aims to understand the interactions among molecules within a cell leading to certain cellular processes in response to a specific environment. While the existing theoretical and experimental approaches enable the investigation of well-known pathways involved in metabolism, gene regulation and signal transduction, bioinformatics methods offer new insights into computational modeling of biological pathways. A wide range of computational approaches has been proposed in the past for reconstructing biological pathways from high-throughput datasets. Here we review selected bioinformatics approaches for modeling biological pathways in S. cerevisiae, including metabolic pathways, gene-regulatory pathways and signaling pathways. We start with reviewing the research on biological pathways followed by discussing key biological databases. In addition, several representative computational approaches for modeling biological pathways in yeast are discussed.},

abstract = {Biological and Medical science is increasingly acknowledging the use of gene co-expression networks for the analysis of complex systems or diseases. In many studies, the goal is not only to describe a network, but to investigate how this network is changing under different conditions, with respect to certain diseases, or between different species. While methods for comparing two networks exist, this is not the case for comparing multiple networks, although this is a common aim of many studies. Moreover, much of the power of network analyses is lost when restricting a comparison to solely determining presence/absence of nodes and links. Here we present a method for the comparison of an unlimited number of networks: Co-expression Differential Network Analysis (CoDiNA). Our method distinguishes between links that are common to all networks, links that are specific to only one of the compared networks, and links that are different in that their sign changes between networks. Importantly, we developed a statistical framework to normalize between these different categories of common or changed network links. Our approach also allows us to categorize nodes as dominated by common, specific, or differentiated links. We demonstrate the usage of our new method by presenting the analysis of a dataset consisting of different types of cancers. We revealed common, specific, and differentiated links between cancer types and show that each category of links is enriched for genes with distinct Gene Ontology groups. This suggests that our method can detect functional differences. CoDiNA has been implemented in an R package that is available from CRAN.},

abstract = {The TORC2 gene is a member of the transducer of the regulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein gene family, which plays a key role in metabolism and adipogenesis. In the present study, we confirmed the role of TORC2 in bovine preadipocyte proliferation through cell cycle staining flow cytometry, cell counting assay, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine staining (EdU), and mRNA and protein expression analysis of proliferation-related marker genes. In addition, Oil red O staining analysis, immunofluorescence of adiponectin, mRNA and protein level expression of lipid related marker genes confirmed the role of TORC2 in the regulation of bovine adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, the transcription start site and sub-cellular localization of the TORC2 gene was identified in bovine adipocytes. To investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism of the bovine TORC2, we cloned a 1990 bp of the 5' untranslated region (5′UTR) promoter region into a luciferase reporter vector and seven vector fragments were constructed through serial deletion of the 5′UTR flanking region. The core promoter region of the TORC2 gene was identified at location −314 to −69 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Based on the results of the transcriptional activities of the promoter vector fragments, luciferase activities of mutated fragments and siRNAs interference, four transcription factors (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein C/BEP, X-box binding protein 1 XBP1, Insulinoma-associated 1 INSM1, and Zinc finger protein 263 ZNF263) were identified as the transcriptional regulators of TORC2 gene. These findings were further confirmed through Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) within nuclear extracts of bovine adipocytes. Furthermore, we also identified that C/EBP, XBP1, INSM1 and ZNF263 regulate TORC2 gene as activators in the promoter region. We can conclude that TORC2 gene is potentially a positive regulator of adipogenesis. These findings will not only provide an insight for the improvement of intramuscular fat in cattle, but will enhance our understanding regarding therapeutic intervention of metabolic syndrome and obesity in public health as well.},

abstract = {Aberrantly expressed microRNAs have been implicated in lots of cancers. Reduced amounts of let-7g have been found in breast cancer tissues. The function of let-7g in bone metastasis of breast cancer remains poorly understood. This study is to explore the significance of let-7g and its novel target gene in bone metastasis of breast cancer. The expression of let-7g or forkhead box C2 (FOXC2) was measured in human clinical breast cancer tissues with bone metastasis by using quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). After transfection with let-7g or anti-let-7g in breast cancer cell linesMDA-MB-231or SK-BR3, qRT-PCR and Western blot were done to test the levels of let-7g and FOXC2. The effect of anti-let-7g and/ or FOXC2 RNA interference (RNAi) on cell migration in breast cancer cells was evaluated by using wound healing assay. Clinically, qRT-PCR showed that FOXC2 levels were higher in breast cancer tissues with bone metastasis than those in their noncancerous counterparts. Let-7g was showed to be negatively correlated with FOXC2 in human breast cancer samples with bone metastasis. We found that enforced expression of let-7g reduced levels of FOXC2 protein by using Western blot in MDA-MB-231 cells. Conversely, anti-let-7g enhanced levels of FOXC2 in SK-BR3 cells. In terms of function, anti-let-7g accelerated migration of SK-BR3 cells. Interestingly, FOXC2 RNAi abrogated anti-let-7g-mediated migration in breast cancer cells. Thus, we conclude that let-7g suppresses cell migration through targeting FOXC2 in breast cancer. Our finding provides a new perspective for understanding the mechanism of bone metastasis in breast cancer.},

abstract = {Sheep are small ruminants, and their long intestines exhibit high digestive and absorptive capacity in many different rearing conditions; however, the genetic bases of this characteristic remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a major role in maintaining both intestinal morphological structure as well as in regulating the physiological functions of this organ. However, no study has reported on the miRNA expression profile in the intestinal tissues of sheep. Here, we analyzed and identified the miRNA expression profile of three different intestinal tissues (i.e., duodenum, cecum, and colon) of sheep (Ovis aries) using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic methods. In total, 106 known miRNAs were identified, 458 conserved miRNAs were detected, 192 unannotated novel miRNAs were predicted, and 195 differentially expressed miRNAs were found between the different tissues. Additionally, 3,437 candidate target genes were predicted, and 17 non-redundant significantly enriched GO terms were identified using enrichment analysis. A total of 99 candidate target genes were found to significantly enriched in 4 KEGG biological pathways. A combined regulatory network was constructed based on 92 metabolism-related candidate target genes and 65 differentially expressed miRNAs, among which 7 miRNAs were identified as hub miRNAs. Via these mechanisms, miRNAs may play a role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and metabolism. This study helps to further explain the mechanisms that underlie differences in tissue morphology and function in three intestinal segments of sheep.},

Given the heterogeneity of mutations in cancer cells, considerable focus has been directed toward characterizing metastasis genes in the context of relevant signaling pathways rather than treating genes as independent and equal entities. One signaling cascade implicated in the regulation of cell growth, invasion and metastasis is the MAP kinase pathway. Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) functions as an inhibitor of the MAP kinase pathway and is a metastasis suppressor in different cancer models. By utilizing statistical analysis of clinical data integrated with experimental validation, we recently identified components of the RKIP signaling pathway relevant to breast cancer metastasis. Using the RKIP pathway as an example, we show how prior biological knowledge can be efficiently combined with genome-wide patient data to identify gene regulatory mechanisms that control metastasis.},

A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set.

The secreted level of CD166 with radioresistant NPC was significantly higher than that with radiosensitive NPC. In vitro, the CD166 positive rate in the CNE2 cell membrane was significantly lower than that in the CNE2R cell membrane. The magnetic-activated cell sorting technology was used to obtain CNE-2R-CD166(+) and CNE-2R-CD166(-) cell lines. Then radiosensitivity, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were assessed using colony formation assay, cell counting kit 8 assay (CCK-8), and flow cytometry, respectively. The radiation sensitivity ratio was 1.28, indicating that the CNE2R-CD166(-) cells had a stronger radiation sensitivity. The result of CCK-8 assay indicated that the survival fraction of CNE2R-CD166(+) cells was significantly higher than that of CNE2R-CD166(-) cells. The apoptotic rate of CNE2R-CD166(+) cells was significantly lower than that of CNE2R-CD166(-) cells.

abstract = {Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the methylation of arginine residues on target proteins, thereby mediating a diverse set of intracellular functions that are indispensable for survival. Indeed, full-body knockouts of specific PRMTs are lethal and PRMT dysregulation has been implicated in the most prevalent chronic disorders, such as cancers and cardiovascular disease. PRMTs are now emerging as important mediators of skeletal muscle phenotype and plasticity. Since their first description in muscle in 2002, a number of studies employing wide varieties of experimental models support the hypothesis that PRMTs regulate multiple aspects of skeletal muscle biology, including development and regeneration, glucose metabolism, as well as oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, investigations in non-muscle cell types strongly suggest that proteins such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\gamma$ coactivator-1$\alpha$, E2F transcription factor 1, receptor interacting protein 140, and the tumor suppressor protein p53, are putative downstream targets of PRMTs that regulate muscle phenotype determination and remodelling. Recent studies demonstrating that PRMT function is dysregulated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis suggests that altering PRMT expression and/or activity may have therapeutic value for neuromuscular disorders. This review summarizes our understanding of PRMT biology in skeletal muscle, and identifies uncharted areas that warrant further investigation in this rapidly expanding field of research.},

We identified 1,335 high-confidence interactions (1,104 previously unreported), implicating these phosphatases in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes. Systematic phenotypic profiling of phosphatase catalytic and regulatory subunits revealed that phosphatases from every evolutionary family impinge on mitosis. Using clues from the interactome, we have uncovered unsuspected roles for DUSP19 in mitotic exit, CDC14A in regulating microtubule integrity, PTPRF in mitotic retraction fiber integrity, and DUSP23 in centriole duplication. The functional phosphatase interactome further provides a rich resource for ascribing functions for this important class of enzymes.},

In cancer, the loss of tumour-suppressive miRNAs enhances the expression of target oncogenes, whereas increased expression of oncogenic miRNAs (known as oncomirs) can repress target tumour suppressor genes. This realization has resulted in a quest to understand the pathways that are regulated by these miRNAs using in vivo model systems, and to comprehend the feasibility of targeting oncogenic miRNAs and restoring tumour-suppressive miRNAs for cancer therapy.

abstract = {Biological networks have an inherent simplicity: they are modular with a design that can be separated into units that perform almost independently. Furthermore, they show reuse of recurring patterns termed network motifs. Little is known about the evolutionary origin of these properties. Current models of biological evolution typically produce networks that are highly nonmodular and lack understandable motifs. Here, we suggest a possible explanation for the origin of modularity and network motifs in biology. We use standard evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks. A key feature in this study is evolution under an environment (evolutionary goal) that changes in a modular fashion. That is, we repeatedly switch between several goals, each made of a different combination of subgoals. We find that such "modularly varying goals" lead to the spontaneous evolution of modular network structure and network motifs. The resulting networks rapidly evolve to satisfy each of the different goals. Such switching between related goals may represent biological evolution in a changing environment that requires different combinations of a set of basic biological functions. The present study may shed light on the evolutionary forces that promote structural simplicity in biological networks and offers ways to improve the evolutionary design of engineered systems.},

abstract = {Treatment of cancer cell lines with high levels of nitric oxide (NO) via NO donors, such as DETANONOate, inhibits cell growth and survival pathways and sensitizes resistant tumor cells to apoptosis by chemoimmunotherapeutic drugs. In addition, we recently have reported that NO also inhibits the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in metastatic cancer cell lines via dysregulation of the nuclear factor (NF)-$\kappa$B/Snail/Yin Yang 1 (YY1)/Raf kinase inhibitor protein circuitry. The mechanism underlying NO-mediated dysregulation of this circuit was investigated, namely, NO-mediated inhibition of the activity of the transcription factors NF-$\kappa$B, Snail, and YY1. We hypothesized that one mechanism of NO-mediated inhibition may invoke the NO-induced S-nitrosylation of these transcription factors. We demonstrate in metastatic and EMT(+) human prostate carcinoma cell lines that treatment with NO results in the S-nitrosylation of NF-$\kappa$B (p50), Snail, and YY1 and inhibits their activities, resulting in the reversal of the EMT phenotype into a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition phenotype. These findings suggest that NO donors may be potential therapeutic agents in both the reversal of resistance and the inhibition of EMT and metastasis.},

However, only a small percentage of breast tumors is related to family history and mutational inactivation of TSG. Epigenetics refers to non-mutational events that alter gene expression. Endocrine disruptors found in foods and drinking water may disrupt epigenetically hormonal regulation and increase breast cancer risk. This review centers on the working hypothesis that agonists of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR); bisphenol A (BPA); and arsenic compounds, induce in TSG epigenetic signatures that mirror those often seen in sporadic breast tumors. Conversely, it is hypothesized that bioactive food components that target epigenetic mechanisms protect against sporadic breast cancer induced by these disruptors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This review highlights 1) overlaps between epigenetic signatures placed in TSG by AHR-ligands, BPA, and arsenic with epigenetic alterations associated with sporadic breast tumorigenesis; and 2) potential opportunities for prevention of sporadic breast cancer with food components that target the epigenetic machinery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Characterizing the overlap between epigenetic signatures elicited in TSG by endocrine disruptors with those observed in sporadic breast tumors may afford new strategies for breast cancer prevention with specific bioactive food components or diet.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}All mammals own two main forms of fat. The classical white adipose tissue builds up energy in the form of triglycerides and is useful for preventing fatigue during periods of low caloric intake and the brown adipose tissue instead of inducing fat accumulation can produce energy as heat. Since adult humans possess significant amounts of active brown fat depots and their mass inversely correlates with adiposity, brown fat might play an important role in human obesity and energy homeostasis. New evidence suggests two types of thermogenic adipocytes with distinct developmental and anatomical features: classical brown adipocytes and beige adipocytes. Beige adipocyte has recently attracted special interest because of its ability to dissipate energy and the possible ability to differentiate itself from white adipocytes. Importantly, adult human brown adipocyte appears to be mainly composed of beige-like adipocytes, making this cell type an attractive therapeutic target for obesity and obesity-related diseases. Because many epigenetic changes can affect beige adipocyte differentiation, the knowledge of the circumstances that affect the development of beige adipocyte cells may be important for therapeutic strategies. In this review we discuss some recent observations arising from the great physiological capacity of these cells and their possible role as ways to treat obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) regulates growth and differentiation and plays a role in key signal transduction cascades in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism for which RKIP regulates cell-cell adhesion remains unknown. Our study investigated the function of the RKIP overexpression on adhesion molecules expression induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in cultured mouse vascular smooth muscle cells (MOVACs). MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were detected by ELISA kit, reverse transcription-PCR, and western blot assays. The protein expression of RKIP, p65, and inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) were detected by western blot analysis. The activity of NF-kappaB was determined using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay. RESULTS The results showed that MOVACs transfected with pCMV5-HA-RKIP significantly inhibited TNF-alpha induced mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. The adhesion of THP-1 cells was also detected and inhibited by pCMV5-HA-RKIP in TNF-alpha-treated MOVACs. RKIP also suppressed the TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB and the protein expression of phosphorylated IkappaB-alpha, and promoted the protein expression of IkB-alpha and nuclear translocation of p65 NF-kappaB. Furthermore, RKIP and the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (BAY11-7082) reduced the upregulation of ICAM-1 and VACM-1 induced by TNF-alpha. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these results suggested that RKIP may inhibit the TNF-alpha-induced expression of adhesion molecules in MOVACs through inactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway.},

Although the role of Parkin in neuron maintenance is unknown, recent work has linked Parkin to the regulation of mitochondria. Its loss is associated with swollen mitochondria and muscle degeneration in Drosophila melanogaster, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility to mitochondrial toxins in other species. Here, we show that Parkin is selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential in mammalian cells. After recruitment, Parkin mediates the engulfment of mitochondria by autophagosomes and the selective elimination of impaired mitochondria. These results show that Parkin promotes autophagy of damaged mitochondria and implicate a failure to eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.},

Current evidence indicates that miR-33b is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, glucose metabolism and several human diseases; however, whether miR-33b contributes to the pathogenesis of human cancers and participates in the regulation of self-renewal of human cancer stem cells remains unknown. Here, we report the identification of miR-33b as a negative regulator of cell stemness and metastasis in breast cancer. Compared with paired normal breast tissues, miR-33b expression is downregulated in breast tumor samples and is inversely correlated with lymph node metastatic status. Ectopic overexpression of miR-33b in highly metastatic breast cancer cells suppresses cell self-renewal, migration and invasion in vitro and inhibits lung metastasis in vivo. Conversely, miR-33b knockdown promotes the self-renewal, migration and invasion capabilities of noncancerous mammary epithelial cells. The mechanism through which miR-33b inhibits the stemness, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells is by targeting HMGA2, SALL4 and Twist1. These data indicate that miR-33b acts as an onco-suppressive microRNA in breast cancer progression by inhibiting the stemness and metastasis of breast cancer cells.},

abstract = {The transcriptional factor FoxO1 plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis. Herein we identify a novel transrepressional function that converts FoxO1 from an activator of transcription to a promoter-specific repressor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) target genes that regulate adipocyte biology. FoxO1 transrepresses PPAR$\gamma$ via direct protein-protein interactions; it is recruited to PPAR response elements (PPRE) on PPAR$\gamma$ target genes by PPAR$\gamma$ bound to PPRE and interferes with promoter DNA occupancy of the receptor. The FoxO1 transrepressional function, which is independent and dissectible from the transactivational effects, does not require a functional FoxO1 DNA binding domain, but dose require an evolutionally conserved 31 amino acids LXXLL-containing domain. Insulin induces FoxO1 phosphorylation and nuclear exportation, which prevents FoxO1-PPAR$\gamma$ interactions and rescues transrepression. Adipocytes from insulin resistant mice show reduced phosphorylation and increased nuclear accumulation of FoxO1, which is coupled to lowered expression of endogenous PPAR$\gamma$ target genes. Thus the innate FoxO1 transrepression function enables insulin to augment PPAR$\gamma$ activity, which in turn leads to insulin sensitization, and this feed-forward cycle represents positive reinforcing connections between insulin and PPAR$\gamma$ signaling. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2 form a functional complex and inhibit the phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1, two key regulators of translation. Here, we describe that TSC2 is regulated by cellular energy levels and plays an essential role in the cellular energy response pathway. Under energy starvation conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances its activity. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK is required for translation regulation and cell size control in response to energy deprivation. Furthermore, TSC2 and its phosphorylation by AMPK protect cells from energy deprivation-induced apoptosis. These observations demonstrate a model where TSC2 functions as a key player in regulation of the common mTOR pathway of protein synthesis, cell growth, and viability in response to cellular energy levels.},

abstract = {Class I PI3-kinases signal downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors and have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Although the oncogenic potential of the PI3-kinase subunit p110$\alpha$ requires its mutational activation, other p110 isoforms can induce transformation when overexpressed in the wild-type state. In wild-type p110$\alpha$, N345 in the C2 domain forms hydrogen bonds with D560 and N564 in the inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain of p85, and mutations of p110$\alpha$ or p85 that disrupt this interface lead to increased basal activity and transformation. Sequence analysis reveals that N345 in p110$\alpha$ aligns with K342 in p110$\beta$. This difference makes wild-type p110$\beta$ analogous to a previously described oncogenic mutant, p110$\alpha$-N345K. We now show that p110$\beta$ is inhibited by p85 to a lesser extent than p110$\alpha$ and is not differentially inhibited by wild-type p85 versus p85 mutants that disrupt the C2iSH2 domain interface. Similar results were seen in soft agar and focus-formation assays, where p110$\beta$ was similar to p110$\alpha$-N345K in transforming potential. Inhibition of p110$\beta$ by p85 was enhanced by a K342N mutation in p110$\beta$, which led to decreased activity in vitro, decreased basal Akt and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) activation, and decreased transformation in NIH 3T3 cells. Moreover, unlike wild-type p110$\beta$, p110$\beta$-K342N was differentially regulated by wild-type and mutant p85, suggesting that the inhibitory C2iSH2 interface is functional in this mutant. This study shows that the enhanced transforming potential of p110$\beta$ is the result of its decreased inhibition by p85, due to the disruption of an inhibitory C2iSH2 domain interface.},

Approximately, two thirds of the TF-bound regions fell into CRMs. Less than half of the human CRMs were found as a CRM in the orthologous region of a second species. Shared CRMs were associated with liver pathways and disease loci identified by genome-wide association studies. Recurrent rare human disease causing mutations at the promoters of several blood coagulation and lipid metabolism genes were also identified within CRMs shared in multiple species.

abstract = {The Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is down-regulated in multiple types of human cancers. Decreased RKIP transcription activity may be one of the major mechanisms responsible for the downregulation of RKIP expression in human diseases. To test this hypothesis, we need to gain basic knowledge of the transcriptional regulation of RKIP. To achieve this objective, we made a systematic effort to identify cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that control RKIP promoter activity. We found that full RKIP promoter activity requires the region -56 to +261 relative to the transcription start site. Within the full promoter region, there are two motifs rich in G/C that responded to transcription factor Sp1, one cAMP-responsive element that responded to the transcription factor CREB, and one docking site for the histone acetylase p300. In human melanoma A375 cells and human cervical cancer HeLa cells, mutation or deletion of each of these cis-acting elements decreased promoter activity. In A375 cells, knockdown of the corresponding transcription factors Sp1, CREB, or p300 decreased RKIP promoter activity, whereas overexpression of CREB and p300 increased RKIP promoter activity. The results obtained with HeLa cells also supported the idea that Sp1 and CREB play positive roles in the regulation of RKIP transcription. These findings suggest that regulators of the expression or activity of Sp1, CREB, and p300 are involved in regulating RKIP transcription.},

Drosophila atonal coding sequence was endogenously replaced with that of atonal homologues (ATHs) at key phylogenetic positions, non-ATH proneural genes, and the closest homologue to ancestral proneural genes. ATHs and the ancestral-like coding sequences rescued sensory organ fate in atonal mutants, in contrast to non-ATHs. Surprisingly, different ATH factors displayed different levels of proneural activity as reflected by the number and functionality of sense organs. This proneural potency gradient correlated directly with ATH protein stability, including in response to Notch signaling, independently of mRNA levels or codon usage. This establishes a distinct and ancient function for ATHs and demonstrates that coding sequence evolution can underlie quantitative variation in sensory development and function.},

abstract = {The identification of transcription factors (TFs) responsible for the co-regulation of specific sets of genes is a common problem in transcriptomics. Herein we describe TFEA.ChIP, a tool to estimate and visualize TF enrichment in gene lists representing transcriptional profiles. To generate the gene sets representing TF targets, we gathered ChIP-Seq experiments from the ENCODE Consortium and GEO datasets and used the correlation between Dnase Hypersensitive Sites across cell lines to generate a database linking TFs with the genes they interact with in each ChIP-Seq experiment. In its current state, TFEA.ChIP covers 327 different transcription factors from 1075 ChIP-Seq experiments, with over 150 cell types being represented. TFEA.ChIP accepts gene sets as well as sorted lists differentially expressed genes to compute enrichment scores for each of the datasets in its internal database using an Fisher's exact association test or a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. We validated TFEA.ChIP using a wide variety of gene sets representing signatures of genetic and chemical perturbations as input and found that the relevant TF was correctly identified in 103 of a total of 144 analyzed datasets with a median area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86. In depth analysis of an RNAseq dataset, illustrates that the use of ChIP-Seq data instead of PWM-based provides key biological context to interpret the results of the analysis. To facilitate its integration into transcriptome analysis pipelines and allow easy expansion and customization of the TF-gene database, we implemented TFEA.ChIP as an R package that can be downloaded from Bioconductor: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/TFEA.ChIP.html and github: https://github.com/LauraPS1/TFEA-drafts. In addition, make it available to a wide range of researches, we have also developed a web application that runs the package from the server side and enables easy exploratory analysis through interactive graphs: https://www.iib.uam.es/TFEA.ChIP/},

abstract = {TLRs (Toll-like receptors) provide a mechanism for host defence immune responses. Activated TLRs lead to the recruitment of adaptor proteins to their cytosolic tails, which in turn promote the activation of IRAKs (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases). IRAKs act upon their transcription factor targets to influence the expression of genes involved in the immune response. Tollip (Toll-interacting protein) modulates IRAK function in the TLR signalling pathway. Tollip is multimodular, with a conserved C2 domain of unknown function. We found that the Tollip C2 domain preferentially interacts with phosphoinositides, most notably with PtdIns3P (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate) and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate), in a Ca2+-independent manner. However, NMR analysis demonstrates that the Tollip C2 domain binds Ca2+, which may be required to target the membrane interface. NMR and lipid-protein overlay analyses suggest that PtdIns3P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 share interacting residues in the protein. Kinetic studies reveal that the C2 domain reversibly binds PtdIns3P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, with affinity values in the low micromolar range. Mutational analysis identifies key PtdIns3P- and PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding conserved basic residues in the protein. Our findings suggest that basic residues of the C2 domain mediate membrane targeting of Tollip by interaction with phosphoinositides, which contribute to the observed partition of the protein in different subcellular compartments.},

abstract = {Therapeutic angiogenesis has emerged as a promising strategy to regenerate the damaged blood vessels resulting from ischemic diseases such as myocardial infarction (MI). However, the functional integration of implanted endothelial cells (ECs) in infarcted heart remains challenging. We herein develop an EC generation approach by inhibiting microRNA-495 (miR-495) in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and assess the angiogenic potential for MI treatment. The anti-angiogenic miR-495 belonging to Dlk1-Dio3 miR cluster was identified through expression profiling and computational analysis. Loss-of-function experiments for miR-495 were performed using a lentiviral transfer of antisense sequence in hiPSCs. The pluripotency of hiPSCs was not impacted by the genetic modification. Induced with differentiation medium, miR-495 inhibition enhanced the expression of EC genes of hiPSCs, as well as the yield of ECs. Newly derived ECs displayed prominent angiogenic characteristics including tube formation, cell migration, and proliferation. Mechanistically, miR-495 mediated the expression of endothelial or angiogenic genes by directly targeting vascular endothelial zinc finger 1. After transplantation in immunodeficient MI mice, the derived ECs significantly increased neovascularization in the infarcted heart, prevented functional worsening, and attenuated expansion of infarct size. The functional integration of the implanted ECs into coronary networks was also enhanced by inhibiting miR-495. miR-495 represents a new target not only for promoting EC generation from hiPSCs but also for enhancing angiogenesis and engraftment of hiPSC-derived ECs in ischemic heart.

Methods Family members were examined for features of syndromic genetic diseases by clinician and geneticist. Genomic DNA was extracted from 2 distantly related members with definite TAAD for exome sequencing.
Results A pathogenic mutation (rs111426349, c.1459C{\textgreater}T) of transforming growth factor $\beta$ receptor 1 (TGFBR1) was confirmed, which result in the amino acid substitution p.R487W. Fourteen TGFBR1 mutation carriers were detected among 39 tested members in this family. The average age at diagnosis of aortic root dilatation or aneurysm was 23.2 ± 12.6 years (range 3-37 years). Early onset of aortic root dilatation was significant in this family without reported phenotypes. The David procedure was performed prophylactically in 3 carriers of this family.
Conclusions Familial TAAD caused by TGFBR1 mutation (c.1459C{\textgreater}T) was confirmed in a large Chinese Han ethnic family using exome sequencing. Aggressively prophylactic David procedure may be not necessary at a smaller aortic size in familial TAAD patients with TGFBR1 mutation and further observation is warranted.},

abstract = {Our recent study showed that SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates apoptosis and vasculogenesis by promoting degradation of NOXA and NF1, and co-operates with Kras to promote lung tumorigenesis by activating NF$\kappa$B and mTOR pathways via targeted degradation of tumor suppressive substrates including I$\kappa$B, DEPTOR, p21 and p27. Here we investigated the role of Sag/Rbx2 E3 ligase in cellular senescence and immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and report that Sag is required for proper cell proliferation and KrasG12D-induced immortalization. Sag inactivation by genetic deletion remarkably suppresses cell proliferation by inducing senescence, which is associated with accumulation of p16, but not p53. Mechanistically, Sag deletion caused accumulation of Jun-B, a substrate of Sag-Fbxw7 E3 ligase and a transcription factor that drives p16 transcription. Importantly, senescence triggered by Sag deletion can be largely rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, the p16 encoding gene, indicating its causal role. Furthermore, KrasG12D-induced immortalization can also be abrogated by Sag deletion via senescence induction, which is again rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a. Finally, we found that Sag deletion inactivates KrasG12D activity and block the MAPK signaling pathway, together with accumulated p16, to induce senescence. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Sag is a KrasG12D-cooperating oncogene required for KrasG12D-induced immortalization and transformation, and targeting SAG-SCF E3 ligase may, therefore, have therapeutic value for senescence-based cancer treatment.},

The introduction of BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations has yielded significant increases in PFS and OS for melanoma. However, at present, no direct comparisons between different BRAF/MEK combinations have been conducted. In light of this, an indirect treatment comparison was performed between two BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapies for metastatic melanoma, dabrafenib plus trametinib and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, in order to understand the relative efficacy and toxicity profiles of these therapies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A systematic literature search identified two randomized trials as suitable for indirect comparison: the coBRIM trial of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib versus vemurafenib and the COMBI-v trial of dabrafenib plus trametinib versus vemurafenib. The comparison followed the method of Bucher et al. and analyzed both efficacy (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS], and overall response rate [ORR]) and safety outcomes (adverse events [AEs]).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The indirect comparison revealed similar efficacy outcomes between both therapies, with no statistically significant difference between therapies for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.68 - 1.30), PFS (HR 1.05, 95{\%} CI 0.79 - 1.40), or ORR (risk ratio [RR] 0.90, 95{\%} CI 0.74 - 1.10). Dabrafenib plus trametinib differed significantly from vemurafenib plus cobimetinib with regard to the incidence of treatment-related AE (RR 0.92, 95{\%} CI 0.87 - 0.97), any AE grade ≥3 (RR 0.71, 95{\%} CI 0.60 - 0.85) or dose interruption/modification (RR 0.77, 95{\%} CI 0.60 - 0.99). Several categories of AEs occurred significantly more frequently with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, while some occurred significantly more frequently with dabrafenib plus trametinib. For severe AEs (grade 3 or above), four occurred significantly more frequently with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib and no severe AE occurred significantly more frequently with dabrafenib plus trametinib.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This indirect treatment comparison suggested that dabrafenib plus trametinib had comparable efficacy to vemurafenib plus cobimetinib but was associated with reduced adverse events.},

The data gained from these samples display the confounding patterns of mixtures consisting of multiple cell types or similar cell types in various functional States, which hinders the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex biological phenomena. A realistic approach to compensate for the limitations of experimentally separating homogenous cell populations from mixed tissues is to computationally identify cell-type specific patterns from bulk, heterogeneous measurements. We designed the CellDistinguisher algorithm to analyze the gene expression data of mixed samples, identifying genes that best distinguish biological processes and cell types. Coupled with a deconvolution algorithm that takes cell type specific gene lists as input, we show that CellDistinguisher performs as well as partial deconvolution algorithms in predicting cell type composition without the need for prior knowledge of cell type signatures. This approach is also better in predicting cell type signatures than the one-step traditional complete deconvolution methods. To illustrate its wide applicability, the algorithm was tested on multiple publicly available data sets. In each case, CellDistinguisher identified genes reflecting biological processes typical for the tissues and development stages of interest and estimated the sample compositions accurately.},

abstract = {Mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) pair to 3′UTRs of mRNAs to direct their posttranscriptional repression. Important for target recognition are ∼7 nt sites that match the seed region of the miRNA. However, these seed matches are not always sufficient for repression, indicating that other characteristics help specify targeting. By combining computational and experimental approaches, we uncovered five general features of site context that boost site efficacy: AU-rich nucleotide composition near the site, proximity to sites for coexpressed miRNAs (which leads to cooperative action), proximity to residues pairing to miRNA nucleotides 13-16, positioning within the 3′UTR at least 15 nt from the stop codon, and positioning away from the center of long UTRs. A model combining these context determinants quantitatively predicts site performance both for exogenously added miRNAs and for endogenous miRNA-message interactions. Because it predicts site efficacy without recourse to evolutionary conservation, the model also identifies effective nonconserved sites and siRNA off-targets. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We identified 67 and 376 inheritable autosomal random monoallelically expressed genes in ESCs and NPCs, respectively, a 5.6-fold increase upon differentiation. Although DNA methylation and nuclear positioning did not distinguish the active and inactive alleles, specific histone modifications were differentially enriched between the two alleles. Interestingly, expression levels of 8{\%} of the monoallelically expressed genes remained similar between monoallelic and biallelic clones.

abstract = {Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is recognized as a major health hazard, but molecular responses are still insufficiently described. We analyzed the epigenetic impact of ambient PM2.5from biomass combustion on the methylome of primary human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The transcriptome was determined by the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Array. PM2.5induced genome wide alterations of the DNA methylation pattern, including differentially methylated CpGs in the promoter region associated with CpG islands. Gene ontology analysis revealed that differentially methylated genes were significantly clustered in pathways associated with the extracellular matrix, cellular adhesion, function of GTPases, and responses to extracellular stimuli, or were involved in ion binding and shuttling. Differential methylations also affected tandem repeats. Additionally, 45 different miRNA CpG loci showed differential DNA methylation, most of them proximal to their promoter. These miRNAs are functionally relevant for lung cancer, inflammation, asthma, and other PM-associated diseases. Correlation of the methylome and transcriptome demonstrated a clear bias toward transcriptional activation by hypomethylation. Genes that exhibited both differential methylation and expression were functionally linked to cytokine and immune responses, cellular motility, angiogenesis, inflammation, wound healing, cell growth, differentiation and development, or responses to exogenous matter. Disease ontology of differentially methylated and expressed genes indicated their prominent role in lung cancer and their participation in dominant cancer related signaling pathways. Thus, in lung epithelial cells, PM2.5alters the methylome of genes and noncoding transcripts or elements that might be relevant for PM- and lung-associated diseases.},

The highest-ranking PIK3CA and PIK3R1 mutations include previously reported deleterious mutations, as well as mutations with unknown significance. These PIK3CA and PIK3R1 impactful mutations exhibit a mutually exclusive pattern, leading to oncogenesis and hyperactivity of PI3K pathway. The PIK3CA impactful mutations are tightly associated with hormone receptor positivity. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of PI3K impactful mutations in breast cancer and have important implications for PI3K-targeted therapy in precision oncology.},

To investigate the effect of Qu in melanoma cells, we used multiple methods, including real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, migration assay, and wound healing assay. We found that EMT was altered by Qu in melanoma cells. Qu-treated cells exhibited decreased migration and invasion activities. Mechanistically, a high expression of epithelial markers and a decrease in the expression of mesenchymal markers were found to be associated with reversal of EMT in melanoma cells. Time-dependent apoptosis was observed in Qu-treated melanoma cells, which was further confirmed by the upregulation in the protein levels of Caspase 3, a proapoptotic marker. Thus, our findings suggest Qu as a promising dietary compound under the new complementary and alternative medicine category of therapeutic drugs in the chemoprevention of melanoma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Gliomas exhibit high glycolytic rates, and monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) play a major role in the maintenance of the glycolytic metabolism through the proton-linked transmembrane transport of lactate. However, their role in gliomas is poorly studied. Thus, we aimed to characterize the expression of MCT1, MCT4, and their chaperone CD147 and to assess the therapeutic impact of MCT inhibition in gliomas. METHODS MCTs and CD147 expressions were characterized by immunohistochemistry in nonneoplastic brain and glioma samples. The effect of CHC (MCT inhibitor) and MCT1 silencing was assessed in in vitro and in vivo glioblastoma models. RESULTS MCT1, MCT4, and CD147 were overexpressed in the plasma membrane of glioblastomas, compared with diffuse astrocytomas and nonneoplastic brain. CHC decreased glycolytic metabolism, migration, and invasion and induced cell death in U251 cells (more glycolytic) but only affected proliferation in SW1088 (more oxidative). The effectiveness of CHC in glioma cells appears to be dependent on MCT membrane expression. MCT1 downregulation showed similar effects on different glioma cells, supporting CHC as an MCT1 inhibitor. There was a synergistic effect when combining CHC with temozolomide treatment in U251 cells. In the CAM in vivo model, CHC decreased the size of tumors and the number of blood vessels formed. CONCLUSIONS This is the most comprehensive study reporting the expression of MCTs and CD147 in gliomas. The MCT1 inhibitor CHC exhibited anti-tumoral and anti-angiogenic activity in gliomas and, of importance, enhanced the effect of temozolomide. Thus, our results suggest that development of therapeutic approaches targeting MCT1 may be a promising strategy in glioblastoma treatment.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Kim et al. Cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 2 (CCAR2) is a multifaceted protein that controls diverse cellular functions; however, its function in cancer is unclear. To better understand its potential role in cancer, we examined gene expression patterns regulated by CCAR2 in cervical cancer cells. Cytokine and chemokine production by CCAR2-deficient cells increased under oxidative conditions. In particular, H 2 O 2 -treated CCAR2-depleted cells showed a significant increase in interleukin-8 (IL-8) production, indicating a negative regulation of IL-8 by CCAR2. Upregulation of IL-8 expression in CCAR2-deficient cells occurred via activation of transcription factor AP-1. The negative correlation between CCAR2 and IL-8 expression was confirmed by examining mRNA and protein levels in tissues from cervical cancer patients. Furthermore, CCAR2- regulated IL-8 expression is associated with a shorter survival of cervical cancer patients. Overall, the data suggest that CCAR2 plays a critical role in controlling both the cancer secretome and cancer progression.},

abstract = {Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG), including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), are the most lethal types of cancer in children. In recent years, it has become evident that these tumors are driven by epigenetic events, mainly mutations involving genes encoding Histone 3, setting them apart from their adult counterparts. These tumors are exceptionally resistant to chemotherapy and respond only temporarily to radiotherapy. Moreover, their delicate location and diffuse growth pattern make complete surgical resection impossible. In many other forms of cancer, chemo- and radioresistance, in combination with a diffuse, invasive phenotype, are associated with a transcriptional program termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Activation of this program allows cancer cells to survive individually, invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. It also enables them to survive exposure to cytotoxic therapy, including chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation. We here suggest that EMT plays an important, yet poorly understood role in the biology and therapy resistance of pHGG and DIPG. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the major signal transduction pathways and transcription factors involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer in general and in pediatric HGG and DIPG in particular. Despite the fact that the mesenchymal transition has not yet been specifically studied in pHGG and DIPG, activation of pathways and high levels of transcription factors involved in EMT have been described. We conclude that the mesenchymal transition is likely to be an important element of the biology of pHGG and DIPG and warrants further investigation for the development of novel therapeutics.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of methyl donor supplementation of pregnant animals in the presence or absence of a concomitant lactation on the methylome of the offspring. Twenty Holstein cows, 10 nulliparous (non-lactating while pregnant) and 10 multiparous (lactating while pregnant) were blocked by parity and randomly assigned to an i.m. weekly injections of a placebo (CTRL) or a solution containing methyl donors (MET). After calving, 5 calves randomly selected from each treatment (two born to non-lactating and three to lactating dams) were blood-sampled to determine their full methylome. There were more than 2,000 CpG differentially methylated between calves born to CTRL and those born to MET, and also between calves born to lactating and non-lactating dams. Most of the differences affected genes involved in immune function, cell growth regulation and differentiation, kinase activity, and ion channeling. We conclude that the coexistence of pregnancy and lactation affects the methylome of the offspring, and that supplementation of methyl donors early in gestation has also consequences on the methylome.},

abstract = {Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) is a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, and genome-wide studies indicate that it is involved in the induction of most adipocyte genes. Here we report, for the first time, the acute effects of the synthetic PPAR$\gamma$ agonist rosiglitazone on the transcriptional network of PPAR$\gamma$ in adipocytes. Treatment with rosiglitazone for 1 hour leads to acute transcriptional activation as well as repression of a number of genes as determined by genome-wide RNA polymerase II occupancy. Unlike what has been shown for many other nuclear receptors, agonist treatment does not lead to major changes in the occurrence of PPAR$\gamma$ binding sites. However, rosiglitazone promotes PPAR$\gamma$ occupancy at many preexisting sites, and this is paralleled by increased occupancy of the mediator subunit MED1. The increase in PPAR$\gamma$ and MED1 binding is correlated with an increase in transcription of nearby genes, indicating that rosiglitazone, in addition to activating the receptor, also promotes its association with DNA, and that this is causally linked to recruitment of mediator and activation of genes. Notably, both rosiglitazone-activated and -repressed genes are induced during adipogenesis. However, rosiglitazone-activated genes are markedly more associated with PPAR$\gamma$ than repressed genes and are highly dependent on PPAR$\gamma$ for expression in adipocytes. By contrast, repressed genes are associated with the other key adipocyte transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer binding protein$\alpha$ (C/EBP$\alpha$), and their expression is more dependent on C/EBP$\alpha$. This suggests that the relative occupancies of PPAR$\gamma$ and C/EBP$\alpha$ are critical for whether genes will be induced or repressed by PPAR$\gamma$ agonist.},

Despite the fact that abundant experiments investigating microRNA expressions in cancer cells have been carried out, the results have remain scattered in the literature. We propose to extract microRNA-cancer associations by text mining and store them in a database called miRCancer.

abstract = {One of the main objectives in the analysis of microarray experiments is the identification of genes that are differentially expressed under two experimental conditions. This task is complicated by the noisiness of the data and the large number of genes that are examined simultaneously. Here, we present a novel technique for identifying differentially expressed genes that does not originate from a sophisticated statistical model but rather from an analysis of biological reasoning. The new technique, which is based on calculating rank products (RP) from replicate experiments, is fast and simple. At the same time, it provides a straightforward and statistically stringent way to determine the significance level for each gene and allows for the flexible control of the false-detection rate and familywise error rate in the multiple testing situation of a microarray experiment. We use the RP technique on three biological data sets and show that in each case it performs more reliably and consistently than the non-parametric t-test variant implemented in Tusher et al.'s significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). We also show that the RP results are reliable in highly noisy data. An analysis of the physiological function of the identified genes indicates that the RP approach is powerful for identifying biologically relevant expression changes. In addition, using RP can lead to a sharp reduction in the number of replicate experiments needed to obtain reproducible results. {\textcopyright} 2004 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

abstract = {UNLABELLED Disease-associated SNPs detected in large-scale association studies are frequently located in non-coding genomic regions, suggesting that they may be involved in transcriptional regulation. Here we describe a new strategy for detecting regulatory SNPs (rSNPs), by combining computational and experimental approaches. Whole genome ChIP-chip data for USF1 was analyzed using a novel motif finding algorithm called BCRANK. 1754 binding sites were identified and 140 candidate rSNPs were found in the predicted sites. For validating their regulatory function, seven SNPs found to be heterozygous in at least one of four human cell samples were investigated by ChIP and sequence analysis (haploChIP). In four of five cases where the SNP was predicted to affect binding, USF1 was preferentially bound to the allele containing the consensus motif. Allelic differences in binding for other proteins and histone marks further reinforced the SNPs regulatory potential. Moreover, for one of these SNPs, H3K36me3 and POLR2A levels at neighboring heterozygous SNPs indicated effects on transcription. Our strategy, which is entirely based on in vivo data for both the prediction and validation steps, can identify individual binding sites at base pair resolution and predict rSNPs. Overall, this approach can help to pinpoint the causative SNPs in complex disorders where the associated haplotypes are located in regulatory regions. AVAILABILITY BCRANK is available from Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}As a tumor suppressor and the most frequently mutated gene in cancer, p53 is among the best-described molecules in medical research. As cancer is in most cases an age-related disease, it seems paradoxical that p53 is so strongly conserved from early multicellular organisms to humans. A function not directly related to tumor suppression, such as the regulation of metabolism in nontransformed cells, could explain this selective pressure. While this role of p53 in cellular metabolism is gradually emerging, it is imperative to dissect the tissue- and cell-specific actions of p53 and its downstream signaling pathways. In this review, we focus on studies reporting p53's impact on adipocyte development, function, and maintenance, as well as the causes and consequences of altered p53 levels in white and brown adipose tissue (AT) with respect to systemic energy homeostasis. While whole body p53 knockout mice gain less weight and fat mass under a high-fat diet owing to increased energy expenditure, modifying p53 expression specifically in adipocytes yields more refined insights: (1) p53 is a negative regulator of in vitro adipogenesis; (2) p53 levels in white AT are increased in diet-induced and genetic obesity mouse models and in obese humans; (3) functionally, elevated p53 in white AT increases senescence and chronic inflammation, aggravating systemic insulin resistance; (4) p53 is not required for normal development of brown AT; and (5) when p53 is activated in brown AT in mice fed a high-fat diet, it increases brown AT temperature and brown AT marker gene expression, thereby contributing to reduced fat mass accumulation. In addition, p53 is increasingly being recognized as crucial player in nutrient sensing pathways. Hence, despite existence of contradictory findings and a varying density of evidence, several functions of p53 in adipocytes and ATs have been emerging, positioning p53 as an essential regulatory hub in ATs. Future studies need to make use of more sophisticated in vivo model systems and should identify an AT-specific set of p53 target genes and downstream pathways upon different (nutrient) challenges to identify novel therapeutic targets to curb metabolic diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRs) have been found to play key roles in various human cancers, but the detailed regulatory mechanism of miR-98 in glioma remains largely unknown. The findings of the present study demonstrated that miR-98 was frequently downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines (U87, U251, U373 and SHG44), and the decreased miR-98 levels were associated with DNA methylation. Treatment with 5-Aza-20-deoxycytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, significantly increased the expression of miR-98 in glioma cells. Moreover, both miR-98 downregulation and methylation were significantly associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype in glioma, as well as shorter survival time of glioma patients. Restoration of miR-98 expression caused a marked decrease in the migration and invasion of U87 cells, but did not affect cell proliferation. Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4) was further identified as a novel target gene of miR-98, and its protein expression was negatively regulated by miR-98 in U87 cells. Restoration of SALL4 expression reversed the suppressive effects of miR-98 on the migration and invasion of U87 cells. Furthermore, SALL4 was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and an inverse correlation between miR-98 and SALL4 expression in glioma tissues was identified. In addition, the increased expression of SALL4 was significantly associated with glioma progression. Taken together, these data demonstrated that downregulation of miR-98, induced by methylation, promotes glioma cell migration and invasion via targeting SALL4. Therefore, miR-98 may become a potential therapeutic candidate for glioma.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. They are involved in the regulation of physiological processes, such as adaptation to physical exercise, and also in disease settings, such as systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), and obesity. In SAH, microRNAs play a significant role in the regulation of key signaling pathways that lead to the hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, proliferation, and phenotypic change in smooth muscle cells, and the hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. MicroRNAs are also involved in the regulation of insulin signaling and blood glucose levels in T2D, and participate in lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, and adipocyte differentiation in obesity, with specific microRNA signatures involved in the pathogenesis of each disease. Many studies report the benefits promoted by exercise training in cardiovascular diseases by reducing blood pressure, glucose levels, and improving insulin signaling and lipid metabolism. The molecular mechanisms involved, however, remain poorly understood, especially regarding the participation of microRNAs in these processes. This review aimed to highlight microRNAs already known to be associated with SAH, T2D, and obesity, as well as their possible regulation by exercise training.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity and lipodystrophy results in major health complications such as heart disease and stroke, and is associated with an increased risk of some cancers. We have previously found that the cell surface receptor CD24 regulates adipogenesis as measured by lipid accumulation and gene expression in mature adipocytes. How CD24 regulates these processes remains unknown. To begin answering this question, we first determined that CD24 does not affect glucose uptake in differentiating adipocytes in vitro. We then examined changes in global gene expression via DNA microarray in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with siRNA-mediated knock-down of CD24 expression. We found that CD24 expression is necessary for upregulation of up to 134 genes. We validated the CD24-mediated regulation of 4 of these genes during in vitro adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 and primary cells isolated from the inguinal white adipose tissue depots of CD24 knockout mice. Surprisingly, we found that only 1 of these genes was also regulated by CD24 in cells from the epididymal depot. Overall, these data suggest that CD24 is necessary for select gene expression in a depot-specific manner during adipogenesis in vitro. These findings could help elucidate the mechanisms regulating lipid accumulation in adipocytes thereby aiding in the development of novel treatment strategies for obesity and lipodystophy.},

To estimate insulin resistance in these children, the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was measured in strict nutritional conditions. GATA-binding and functional effects of rs361072 were explored in transfected cell lines and in lymphocytes from obese children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The rs361072 C/T variant was associated with HOMA-IR in the obese children cohorts (1.7 x 10(-12) {\textless} P {\textless} 2 x 10(-4) for C/C vs. T/T using regression analysis).

As shown by the interaction between BMI and genotype (P = 2.1 x 10(-9)), the association of rs361072 with HOMA-IR depended on BMI and was only marginal in nonobese children (P = 0.04).

Here we examine and model a respiratory infection system in which disruption of host immune functions or of bacterial factors changes the dynamics of the infection. We synthesize the network of interactions between host immune components and two closely related bacteria in the genus Bordetellae. We incorporate existing experimental information on the timing of immune regulatory events into a discrete dynamic model, and verify the model by comparing the effects of simulated disruptions to the experimental outcome of knockout mutations. Our model indicates that the infection time course of both Bordetellae can be separated into three distinct phases based on the most active immune processes. We compare and discuss the effect of the species-specific virulence factors on disrupting the immune response during their infection of naive, antibody-treated, diseased, or convalescent hosts. Our model offers predictions regarding cytokine regulation, key immune components, and clearance of secondary infections; we experimentally validate two of these predictions. This type of modeling provides new insights into the virulence, pathogenesis, and host adaptation of disease-causing microorganisms and allows systems-level analysis that is not always possible using traditional methods.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive dementia in the elderly. It is characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of cognitive abilities and formation of senile plaques, composed mainly of amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of tau protein, in the hippocampus and cortex of afflicted humans. In brains of AD patients the metabolism of A$\beta$ is dysregulated, which leads to the accumulation and aggregation of A$\beta$. Metabolism of A$\beta$ and tau proteins is crucially influenced by autophagy. Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent, homeostatic process, in which organelles and proteins are degraded and recycled into energy. Thus, dysfunction of autophagy is suggested to lead to the accretion of noxious proteins in the AD brain. In the present review, we describe the process of autophagy and its importance in AD. Additionally, we discuss mechanisms and genes linking autophagy and AD, i.e., the mTOR pathway, neuroinflammation, endocannabinoid system,ATG7, BCL2, BECN1, CDK5, CLU, CTSD, FOXO1, GFAP, ITPR1, MAPT, PSEN1, SNCA, UBQLN1, andUCHL1. We also present pharmacological agents acting via modulation of autophagy that may show promise in AD therapy.

Constant ER turnover and modulation is needed to meet different cellular requirements and autophagy has an important role in this process. However, its underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unexplained. Here we show that members of the FAM134 reticulon protein family are ER-resident receptors that bind to autophagy modifiers LC3 and GABARAP, and facilitate ER degradation by autophagy ('ER-phagy'). Downregulation of FAM134B protein in human cells causes an expansion of the ER, while FAM134B overexpression results in ER fragmentation and lysosomal degradation. Mutant FAM134B proteins that cause sensory neuropathy in humans are unable to act as ER-phagy receptors. Consistently, disruption of Fam134b in mice causes expansion of the ER, inhibits ER turnover, sensitizes cells to stress-induced apoptotic cell death and leads to degeneration of sensory neurons. Therefore, selective ER-phagy via FAM134 proteins is indispensable for mammalian cell homeostasis and controls ER morphology and turnover in mice and humans.},

We established an assay to define the chromosomal location of DNA-associated proteins that are slated for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The genome-wide map described here ties proteolysis in mammalian cells to active enhancers and to promoters of specific gene families. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in particular correlate with protein elimination, which positively affects their transcription. We show that the nuclear receptor corepressor NCoR1 is a key target of proteolysis and physically interacts with the transcription factor CREB. Proteasome inhibition stabilizes NCoR1 in a site-specific manner and restrains mitochondrial activity by repressing CREB-sensitive genes. In conclusion, this functional map of nuclear proteolysis links chromatin architecture with local protein stability and identifies proteolytic derepression as highly dynamic in regulating the transcription of genes involved in energy metabolism. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In antigen-induced pulmonary inflammation (AIPI) PRMT1 was up-regulated in the epithelium, while in chronic AIPI, increased PRMT1 shifted to fibroblasts. In this study we investigated the cell type specific regulatory mechanism of PRMT1. Epithelial cells and fibroblasts were stimulated with IL-4 or IL-1beta. Gene and protein expression were determined by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry staining and Western blotting. Signaling pathway inhibitors, siRNAs and shRNA were used to determine the regulatory mechanism of PRMT1. The results showed that IL-4 up-regulated PRMT1 through STAT6 signaling in epithelial cells, while IL-1beta regulated PRMT1 through NF-kappaB in fibroblasts. The NF-kB inhibitor protein RKIP was highly expressed in epithelial cells and blocked IL-1beta induced PRMT1 up-regulation; while the STAT6 inhibitor protein PIAS1 was expressed in fibroblasts and suppressed IL-4 induced PRMT1 expression. Furthermore, IL-4 stimulated epithelial cells to release IL-1beta which up-regulated PRMT1 expression in fibroblasts. In conclusion, the inhibitor proteins RKIP and PIAS1 regulated the cell type and signaling specific expression of PRMT1. Thus PRMT1 expression in structural lung cells in asthma can be considered as potential target for new therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite advances that have been made in systemic chemotherapy, the prognosis of advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is still poor. The identification of key factors governing TNBC development is considered imperative for the development of novel effective therapeutic approaches. Previously, it has been reported that microRNA (miR)-761 may act as either a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene in different types of cancer. Here, we aimed at assessing the biological role of this miRNA in TNBC. METHODS: First, we measured the expression of miR-761 in primary breast cancer tissues and breast cancer-derived cell lines using qRT-PCR. Subsequently, over-expression and silencing experiments were performed to determine the role of miR-761 in TNBC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion in vitro. The in vivo role of miR-761 in TNBC growth and metastasis was determined in mouse models. Bioinformatics analyses, dual-luciferase reporter assays, Western blot analyses and rescue experiments were performed to identify miR-761 target gene(s). RESULTS: We found that miR-761 was up-regulated in primary breast cancer tissues and its derived cell lines and, particularly, in TNBC tissues and cell lines. We also found that exogenous miR-761 over-expression augmented in vitro TNBC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, whereas miR-761 down-regulation impaired these features. In vivo, we found that miR-761 over-expression facilitated TNBC growth and lung metastasis. Mechanistically, miR-761 was found to negatively regulate the expression of tripartite motif-containing 29 (TRIM29) in TNBC cells by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of its mRNA. In conformity with these results, a significant negative correlation between miR-761 expression and TRIM29 protein expression was noted in primary TNBC tissues (r = -0.452, p = 0.0126). We also found that exogenous TRIM29 over-expression reversed the proliferative and invasive capacities of TNBC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that miR-761 acts as an oncogene in TNBC. This mode of action can, at least partially, be ascribed to the down-regulation of its target TRIM29. We suggest that miR-761 may serve as a promising therapeutic target for TNBC.},

Genome-wide studies in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals have revealed common quantitative and combinatorial properties of in vivo DNA binding, as well as marked differences in the rate and mechanisms of evolution of transcription factor binding in metazoans. Here, we review the recently discovered rapid 're-wiring' of in vivo transcription factor binding between related metazoan species and summarize general principles underlying the observed patterns of evolution. We then consider what might explain the differences in genome evolution between metazoan phyla and outline the conceptual and technological challenges facing this research field. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in the  progression and metastasis of numerous cancers. In particular, abnormal expression of miR-378 has been observed in various cancers and is associated with cell survival, migration, invasion, angio-genesis and tumor growth. Our previous studies have shown that miR-378 was decreased in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) plasma and was negatively correlated with NPC progression. However, the tissue expression of miR-378 and its biological function remained unknown in NPC. In this study, we report for the first time that expression level of miR-378 was commonly upregulated in both NPC tissues and NPC cell lines compared to normal healthy nasopharyngeal epithelial samples and human nasopharyngeal epithelial cell lines (NP69), respectively, and was opposite to the reported results in plasma. Functional studies showed that upregulation of miR-378 dramatically promoted cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to predict the target genes of miR-378, and the following mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-378 overexpression was able to downregulate the expression of transducer of ERBB2 (TOB2), a potential tumor suppressor, and miR-378 silencing enhanced TOB2 expression. In clinical specimens, TOB2 was widely repressed in tumor tissues accompanied by miR-378 overexpression. Taken together, this study indicates that miR-378 regulates TOB2 and may function as an onco-miR in NPC progression, providing a potential target for gene therapy of NPC.},

We hypothesised that variations in adipose tissue de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in relation to adiposity might explain some of these observations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:In a cross-sectional study, subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies from 59 people were examined in relation to fasting and post-glucose insulin sensitivity. Adipocyte size, TG fatty acid composition and mRNA expression of lipogenic genes were determined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:We found strong positive relationships between adipose tissue TG content of the fatty acids myristic acid (14:0) and stearic acid (18:0) with insulin sensitivity (HOMA model) (p {\textless} 0.01 for each), and inverse relationships with adipocyte size (p {\textless} 0.01, p {\textless} 0.05, respectively). Variation in 18:0 content was the determinant of the adipose tissue TG 18:1 n-9/18:0 ratio, which correlated negatively with insulin sensitivity (p {\textless} 0.01), as observed previously. Adipose tissue 18:0 content correlated positively with the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes (e.g. FASN, p {\textless} 0.01). Lipogenic gene expression (a composite measure derived from principal components analysis) was inversely correlated with adipocyte cell size (p {\textless} 0.001). There was no relationship between dietary saturated fatty acid intake and adipose tissue 18:0 content.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:Our data suggest a physiological mechanism whereby DNL is downregulated as adipocytes expand. Taken together with other data, they also suggest that hepatic and adipose tissue DNL are not regulated in parallel. We also confirm a strong relationship between small adipocytes and insulin sensitivity, which is independent of BMI.},

We analyzed alignments of 7645 chimpanzee gene sequences to their human and mouse orthologs. These three-species sequence alignments allowed us to identify genes undergoing natural selection along the human and chimp lineage by fitting models that include parameters specifying rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution. This evolutionary approach revealed an informative set of genes with significantly different patterns of substitution on the human lineage compared with the chimpanzee and mouse lineages. Partitions of genes into inferred biological classes identified accelerated evolution in several functional classes, including olfaction and nuclear transport. In addition to suggesting adaptive physiological differences between chimps and humans, human-accelerated genes are significantly more likely to underlie major known Mendelian disorders.},

abstract = {Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) can occur in response to hyperactive oncogenic signals and is believed to be a fail-safe mechanism protecting against tumorigenesis. To identify new factors involved in OIS, we performed a screen for microRNAs that can overcome or inhibit OIS in human diploid fibroblasts. This screen led to the identification of miR-378a-5p and in addition several other miRNAs that have previously been shown to play a role in senescence. We show that ectopic expression of miR-378a-5p reduces the expression of several senescence markers, including p16(INK4A) and senescence-associated $\beta$-galactosidase. Moreover, cells with ectopic expression of miR-378a-5p retain proliferative capacity even in the presence of an activated Braf oncogene. Finally, we identified several miR-378a-5p targets in diploid fibroblasts that might explain the mechanism by which the microRNA can delay OIS. We speculate that miR-378a-5p might positively influence tumor formation by delaying OIS, which is consistent with a known pro-oncogenic function of this microRNA.},

abstract = {Live cell imaging has improved our ability to measure phenotypic heterogeneity. However, bottlenecks in imaging and image processing often make it difficult to differentiate interesting biological behavior from technical artifact. Thus there is a need for new methods that improve data quality without sacrificing throughput. Here we present a 3-step workflow to improve dynamic phenotype measurements of heterogeneous cell populations. We provide guidelines for image acquisition, phenotype tracking, and data filtering to remove erroneous cell tracks using the novel Tracking Aberration Measure (TrAM). Our workflow is broadly applicable across imaging platforms and analysis software. By applying this workflow to cancer cell assays, we reduced aberrant cell track prevalence from 17{\%} to 2{\%}. The cost of this improvement was removing 15{\%} of the well-tracked cells. This enabled detection of significant motility differences between cell lines. Similarly, we avoided detecting a false change in translocation kinetics by eliminating the true cause: varied proportions of unresponsive cells. Finally, by systematically seeking heterogeneous behaviors, we detected subpopulations that otherwise could have been missed, including early apoptotic events and pre-mitotic cells. We provide optimized protocols for specific applications and step-by-step guidelines for adapting them to a variety of biological systems.},

Here we demonstrate that vimentin co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with keratin-KRT14, and mutations in the -YRKLLEGEE- sequence of vimentin significantly reduced migration of the keratinocytes. Our data demonstrates that keratinocyte migration requires the interaction between vimentin and keratins at the -YRKLLEGEE- sequence at the helical 2B domain of vimentin.

abstract = {Biomarker identification, using network methods, depends on finding regular co-expression patterns; the overall connectivity is of greater importance than any single relationship. A second requirement is a simple algorithm for ranking patients on how relevant a gene-set is. For both of these requirements discretized data helps to first identify gene cliques, and then to stratify patients. We explore a biologically intuitive discretization technique which codes genes as up- or down-regulated, with values close to the mean set as unchanged; this allows a richer description of relationships between genes than can be achieved by positive and negative correlation. We find a close agreement between our results and the template gene-interactions used to build synthetic microarray-like data by SynTReN, which synthesizes “microarray” data using known relationships which are successfully identified by our method. We are able to split positive co-regulation into up-together and down-together and negative co-regulation is considered as directed up-down relationships. In some cases these exist in only one direction, with real data, but not with the synthetic data. We illustrate our approach using two studies on white blood cells and derived immortalized cell lines and compare the approach with standard correlation-based computations. No attempt is made to distinguish possible causal links as the search for biomarkers would be crippled by losing highly significant co-expression relationships. This contrasts with approaches like ARACNE and IRIS. The method is illustrated with an analysis of gene-expression for energy metabolism pathways. For each discovered relationship we are able to identify the samples on which this is based in the discretized sample-gene matrix, along with a simplified view of the patterns of gene expression; this helps to dissect the gene-sample relevant to a research topic - identifying sets of co-regulated and anti-regulated genes and the samples or patients in which this relationship occurs.},

ATG9A is recruited to SNX18-induced tubules generated from recycling endosomes and accumulates in juxtanuclear recycling endosomes in cells lacking SNX18.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Radiation is an effective treatment against nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, radioresistance-induced locoregional recurrence remains as a major cause of treatment failure. Therefore, radiosensitivity indicators prior to treatment should be developed to screen radioresistant patients. Previous studies revealed that RKIP (Raf kinase inhibitor protein) is associated with NPC prognosis and radiosensitivity. However, the relationship of p-Ser153 RKIP (RKIP in a phosphorylated form at residue serine153) expression with the effect of radiation and prognosis of NPC patients is not elucidated. Thus, these clinical implication of the phosphorylated RKIP in NPC has yet to be described. METHODS: The effect of p-Ser153 RKIP on locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) was first analyzed in a retrospective cohort of NPC patients without distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. They received radical intensity-modulated radiotherapy alone. Of 180 patients were enrolled in the ongoing matched pair study. The patients were re-classified into radioresistant group or radiosensitive group on the basis of the specified criteria. Patients in the two groups were matched in terms of radiosensitivity-related factors. p-Ser153 RKIP was examined by immunohistochemical staining on a NPC tissue microarray before radiotherapy. The relationship between the expression of p-Ser153 RKIP and the effect of radiotherapy was also analyzed. RESULTS: In this study, a retrospective cohort with 733 cases who received radical radiotherapy alone was established. Using the cohort, we validated that the p-Ser153 RKIP expression observed through immunohistochemical staining in a pretreatment NPC tissue microarray was an independent prognostic factor of LRRFS and OS; we also confirmed that endemic patients with a positive p-Ser153 RKIP expression benefited from irradiation alone in terms of locoregional relapse-free survival. A total of 180 patients were enrolled in a matched pair study. Both groups were well matched in terms of radiosensitivity-related factors. On the basis of the p-Ser153 RKIP expression, we predicted the following data: 80.0 {\%} sensitivity, 73.3 {\%} specificity, 76.7 {\%} accuracy, 75.0 {\%} positive predictive value, and 78.6 {\%} negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed for the first time that positive p-Ser153 RKIP expression was a favorable prognostic factor. It was also positively correlated with the radiosensitivity of NPC. p-Ser153 RKIP could also be used as a biomolecular marker with good availability and authenticity to preliminarily screen NPC-related clinical radiosensitivity.},

However, the clinical relevance of RKIP expression in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remains unclear. In the present study, the expression of RKIP in 85 pairs of TSCC and corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues, 30 matched metastatic lesions from the cervical lymph nodes and 32 oral leukoplakia samples were assessed using immunohistochemical methods. The association between RKIP expression and clinicopathological features was then evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate the effect of RKIP expression on the survival time of patients with TSCC. The results revealed that RKIP expression was dramatically downregulated in TSCC, and to an even greater extent in metastatic lesions. RKIP downregulation was significantly associated with the presence of lymphatic metastasis and the clinical stage of TSCC. Furthermore, patients with low RKIP expression demonstrated a significantly shorter overall survival time. Multivariate analysis indicated that RKIP expression may be an independent prognostic factor in TSCC. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that the lack of RKIP expression is of clinical significance and may serve as a prognostic biomarker in TSCC.},

abstract = {The transcriptional mechanisms by which temporary exposure to developmental signals instigates adipocyte differentiation are unknown. During early adipogenesis, we find transient enrichment of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPbeta), p300, mediator subunit 1, and histone H3 acetylation near genes involved in cell proliferation, development, and differentiation, including the gene encoding the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARgamma2). Occupancy and enhancer function are triggered by adipogenic signals, and diminish upon their removal. GR, which is important for adipogenesis but need not be active in the mature adipocyte, functions transiently with other enhancer proteins to propagate a new program of gene expression that includes induction of PPARgamma2, thereby providing a memory of the earlier adipogenic signal. Thus, the conversion of preadipocyte to adipocyte involves the formation of an epigenomic transition state that is not observed in cells at the beginning or end of the differentiation process.},

In the present study, the biological effects of A and K bicarbonate, alone or in combination (A+K), on breast cancer cell lines were evaluated. The survival of cancer cells was determined by sulforhodamine B cell proliferation assay, while analysis of the cell cycle distribution was conducted via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In addition, the expression of signaling proteins was analyzed upon treatment. The results indicated that there was a heterogeneous response of the different cell lines to A and K, and the best effects were achieved by A+K and A treatment. The interaction between A+K indicated an additive or synergistic effect. In addition, A+K increased the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle, and was the most effective treatment in activating the degradation of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1. In the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, A+K induced the appearance of the 18 kDa isoform of B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein (Bax), which is a more potent inducer of apoptosis than the full-length Bax-p21. The effects of A and K on the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and ERK2 were heterogeneous. In addition, treatment with K, A and A+K inhibited the expression of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B. Overall, the results of the present study indicated that K potentiated the anti-tumoral effects of A in breast cancer cells in vitro. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

However, the role of Tollip in chronic pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the functional significance of Tollip in the regulation of aortic banding-induced cardiac remodelling and its underlying mechanisms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: First, we observed that Tollip was down-regulated in human failing hearts and murine hypertrophic hearts, as determined by western blotting and RT-PCR. Using cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we found that adenovirus vector-mediated overexpression of Tollip limited angiotensin II-induced cell hypertrophy; whereas knockdown of Tollip by shRNA exhibited the opposite effects. We then generated a transgenic (TG) mouse model with cardiac specific-overexpression of Tollip and subjected them to aortic banding (AB) for 8 weeks. When compared with AB-treated wild-type mouse hearts, Tollip-TGs showed a significant attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction, as measured by echocardiography, immune-staining, and molecular/biochemical analysis. Conversely, a global Tollip-knockout mouse model revealed an aggravated cardiac hypertrophy and accelerated maladaptation to chronic pressure overloading. Mechanistically, we discovered that Tollip interacted with AKT and suppressed its downstream signalling pathway. Pre-activation of AKT in cardiomyocytes largely offset the Tollip-elicited anti-hypertrophic effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results provide the first evidence that Tollip serves as a negative regulator of pathological cardiac hypertrophy by blocking the AKT signalling pathway.},

The association literatures were identified from PubMed and Cochrane Library on 1 October 2013, and eligible reports were recruited and synthesized. Four reports were recruited into this meta-analysis for the association of T$\beta$R-I 6A/9A gene polymorphism with ovarian cancer risk. 6A allele and 6A/6A genotype of T$\beta$R-I were associated with the ovarian cancer risk (6A: OR = 1.24, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-1.51, p = 0.03; 6A/6A: OR = 2.30, 95{\%} CI: 1.01-5.22, p = 0.05). However, T$\beta$R-I 9A/9A genotype was not associated with the risk of ovarian cancer (OR = 0.82, 95{\%} CI: 0.66-1.02, p = 0.08).

abstract = {Coordinated gene regulation within the vascular endothelium is required for normal cardiovascular patterning during development and for vascular homeostasis during adulthood, yet little is known about the mechanisms that regulate endothelial transcriptional events. Vascular endothelial zinc finger 1 (Vezf1)/DB1 is a recently identified zinc finger-containing protein that is expressed specifically within endothelial cells during development. In this report, we demonstrate that Vezf1/DB1 is a nuclear localizing protein that potently and specifically activates transcription mediated by the human endothelin-1 promoter, in a Tax-independent manner, in transient transfection assays. Using a combination of deletion mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, a novel Vezf1/DB1-responsive element was localized to a 6-base pair (bp) motif, ACCCCC, located 47 bp upstream of the endothelin-1 transcription start site. Recombinant Vezf1/DB1 also bound to this sequence, and a 2-bp mutation in this element abolished Vezf1/DB1 responsiveness by the endothelin-1 promoter. Vezf1/DB1 could be identified with a specific antibody in nuclear complexes from endothelial cells that bound to this element. Regulation of endothelin-1 promoter activity by Vezf1/DB1 provides a mechanism for endothelin-1 expression in the vascular endothelium during development and to maintain vascular tone; Vezf1/DB1 itself is a candidate transcription factor for modifying endothelial cell phenotypes in order to appropriately assemble and maintain the cardiovascular system.},

However, it remains blurred whether Netrin-1 can protect neurons from apoptosis induced by cerebral stroke. In the current study, the cultured rat primary cortical neurons were transfected with Netrin-1-encoding lentivirus before the oxygenglucose-deprivation (OGD) treatment. Cell death and apoptosis were evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and flow cytometry. We found that Netrin-1 attenuated OGD-induced cell death and neuronal apoptosis at 24 h after OGD treatment, and that the overexpression of Netrin-1 activated the ERK signaling pathway. These effects were partly abolished by blocking its receptor deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) or U0126, an inhibitor of the ERK signaling pathway. Netrin-1 overexpression in neurons elevated the expression of DCC, on mRNA level and protein level. Netrin-1 also reduced DNA damage. Taken together, our findings suggest that Netrin-1 attenuates cell death and neuronal apoptosis via the DCC/ERK signaling pathway in the cultured primary cortical neurons after OGD injury, which may involve the mediation of DNA damage in the neurons.},

Genetic analysis of AMPK or ULK1 in mammalian liver and Caenorhabditis elegans revealed a requirement for these kinases in autophagy. In mammals, loss of AMPK or ULK1 resulted in aberrant accumulation of the autophagy adaptor p62 and defective mitophagy. Reconstitution of ULK1-deficient cells with a mutant ULK1 that cannot be phosphorylated by AMPK revealed that such phosphorylation is required for mitochondrial homeostasis and cell survival during starvation.

Celastrol is a natural compound that has exhibits antiproliferative activity; however, its effects on metastasis-related phenotypes in ovarian cancer models are unclear. In the current study, the anti-invasive activities and associated signaling pathways of celastrol were determined in ovarian cancer cells. Cell proliferation was tested by MTT assay. Cell migration was detected by wound healing and Transwell assays, while cell invasion was detected by a Matrigel-coated Transwell method. In addition, nuclear factor (NF)-$\kappa$B and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression was examined by western blotting, and MMP-2/-9 activities were determined by gelatin zymography. At sub-toxic concentrations ({\textless}0.5 µM), celastrol inhibited migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells. At the molecular level, celastrol blocked the canonical NF-$\kappa$B pathway by inhibiting I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ phosphorylation, and preventing I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ degradation and p65 accumulation. Furthermore, the expression and activity of the NF-$\kappa$B target protein MMP-9, but not MMP-2, were inhibited by celastrol. Furthermore, celastrol showed no synergistic effect with MG132, an NF-$\kappa$B inhibitor. In conclusion, celastrol exhibited significant anti-invasive activities in ovarian cancer cells. Such functions may be mediated via NF-$\kappa$B pathway blockade. The results of this in vitro study strengthen the value of applying celastrol as a potential clinical intervention modality for delaying ovarian cancer metastasis. This, celastrol warrants further preclinical investigation.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) often work cooperatively, where the binding of one TF to DNA enhances the binding affinity of a second TF to a nearby location. Such cooperative binding is important for activating gene expression from promoters and enhancers in both prokary-otic and eukaryotic cells. Existing methods to detect cooperative binding of a TF pair rely on analyzing the sequence that is bound. We propose a method that uses, instead, only ChIP-seq peak intensities and an expectation maximization (CPI-EM) algorithm. We validate our method using ChIP-seq data from cells where one of a pair of TFs under consideration has been genetically knocked out. Our algorithm relies on our observation that cooperative TF-TF binding is correlated with weak binding of one of the TFs, which we demonstrate in a variety of cell types, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae and M. musculus cells. We show that this method performs significantly better than a predictor based only on the ChIP-seq peak distance of the TFs under consideration. This suggests that peak intensities contain information that can help detect the cooperative binding of a TF pair. CPI-EM also outperforms an existing sequence-based algorithm in detecting cooperative binding. The CPI-EM algorithm is available at https://github.com/vishakad/cpi-em.},

The role of p110$\delta$ PI3K in normal or pathological immune responses is well established, yet the importance of p110$\alpha$ subunits in T cell-dependent immune responses is not clear. To address this problem, mice with p110$\alpha$ conditionally deleted in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes (p110$\alpha$-/-$\Delta$T) were used. p110$\alpha$-/-$\Delta$T mice show normal development of T cell subsets, but slightly reduced numbers of CD4+ T cells in the spleen.

Tfh derived from p110$\alpha$-/-$\Delta$T cells also have enhanced responses when compared to normal mice, and IL-2 expanded p110$\alpha$-/-$\Delta$T CD8+ T cells had enhanced levels of LAMP-1 and Granzyme B.

Here, we investigated clinical implications of miR-543 and mechanisms underlying miR-543-mediated CRC development. In this study, real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) validated miR-543 was highly expressed in CRC samples and cell lines. MiR-543 was closely associated with tumor size, TNM stage and metastasis. In addition, survival analysis showed that high miR-543 expression was obviously correlated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. Mechanically, downregulation of miR-543 by miR-543 inhibitor obviously repressed cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, affected migration and invasion. Moreover, luciferase reporter analysis identified that Kr{\"{u}}ppel-like Factor-4 (KLF4) was a direct target of miR-543, and there was an obvious inverse correlation between miR-543 and KLF4 expression in CRC tissues. Furthermore, KLF4 down-regulation favors miR-543-induced oncogenic effect on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, this study indicated that miR-543 facilitates colorectal cancer proliferation and metastasis by targeting KLF4, and miR-543 may serve as a promising target for the treatment of CRC patients.},

In the vast majority of the cases, models focus on specific subsystems, and in particular describe either metabolism, gene expression or signal transduction. Integrated models that are able to span and interconnect these layers are, by contrast, rare as their construction and analysis face multiple challenges. Such methods, however, would represent extremely useful tools to understand cell behaviour, with application in distinct fields of biological and medical research. In particular, they could be useful tools to study genotype-phenotype mappings, and the way they are affected by specific conditions or perturbations. Here, we review existing computational approaches that integrate signalling, gene regulation and/or metabolism. We describe existing challenges, available methods and point at potentially useful strategies.},

abstract = {Metastasis remains the most deadly aspect of cancer and still evades direct treatment. Clinically and experimentally, primary tumor development and metastasis are distinct processes-locally growing tumors can progress without the development of metastases. The discovery of endogenous molecules that exclusively inhibit metastasis suggests that metastasis is an amenable therapeutic target. By definition, metastasis suppressors inhibit metastasis without inhibiting tumorigenicity and are thus distinct from tumor suppressors. As the biology underlying functional mechanisms of metastasis suppressors becomes clearer, it is evident that metastasis suppressors could be harnessed as direct drug targets, prognostic markers, and to understand the fundamental biology of the metastatic process. Metastasis suppressors vary widely in their cellular localization: they are found in every cellular compartment and some are secreted. In general, metastasis suppressors appear to regulate selectively how cells respond to exogenous signals, by affecting signaling cascades which regulate downstream gene expression. This review briefly summarizes current functional and biochemical data on metastasis suppressors implicated in breast cancer. We also present a schematic integrating known mechanisms for these metastasis suppressors highlighting potential targets for therapeutic intervention.},

We designed a graph-based approach to integrate cross-platform microarray data, and extract recurrent expression patterns. A series of microarray datasets can be modeled as a series of co-expression networks, in which we search for frequently occurring network patterns. The integrative approach provides three major advantages over the commonly used microarray analysis methods: (1) enhance signal to noise separation (2) identify functionally related genes without co-expression and (3) provide a way to predict gene functions in a context-specific way.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We integrate 65 human microarray datasets, comprising 1105 experiments and over 11 million expression measurements. We develop a data mining procedure based on frequent itemset mining and biclustering to systematically discover network patterns that recur in at least five datasets. This resulted in 143,401 potential functional modules. Subsequently, we design a network topology statistic based on graph random walk that effectively captures characteristics of a gene's local functional environment. Function annotations based on this statistic are then subject to the assessment using the random forest method, combining six other attributes of the network modules. We assign 1126 functions to 895 genes, 779 known and 116 unknown, with a validation accuracy of 70{\%}. Among our assignments, 20{\%} genes are assigned with multiple functions based on different network environments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://zhoulab.usc.edu/ContextAnnotation.},

abstract = {The number of complete, publicly available genome sequences is now greater than 200, and this number is expected to rapidly grow in the near future as metagenomic and environmental sequencing efforts escalate and the cost of sequencing drops. In order to make use of this data for understanding particular organisms and for discerning general principles about how organisms function, it will be necessary to reconstruct their various biochemical reaction networks. Principal among these will be transcriptional regulatory networks. Given the physical and logical complexity of these networks, the various sources of (often noisy) data that can be utilized for their elucidation, the monetary costs involved, and the huge number of potential experiments approximately 10(12)) that can be performed, experiment design algorithms will be necessary for synthesizing the various computational and experimental data to maximize the efficiency of regulatory network reconstruction. This paper presents an algorithm for experimental design to systematically and efficiently reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks. It is meant to be applied iteratively in conjunction with an experimental laboratory component. The algorithm is presented here in the context of reconstructing transcriptional regulation for metabolism in Escherichia coli, and, through a retrospective analysis with previously performed experiments, we show that the produced experiment designs conform to how a human would design experiments. The algorithm is able to utilize probability estimates based on a wide range of computational and experimental sources to suggest experiments with the highest potential of discovering the greatest amount of new regulatory knowledge.},

Suppression of TGF$\beta$ receptor signaling in $\beta$-cells has been shown to increase $\beta$-cell proliferation in mice, but has not been rigorously examined in humans. Here, treatment of human islets with a TGF$\beta$ receptor I inhibitor, SB-431542 (SB), significantly improved C-peptide secretion by $\beta$-cells, and significantly increased $\beta$-cell number by increasing $\beta$-cell proliferation. In addition, SB increased cell-cycle activators and decreased cell-cycle suppressors in human $\beta$-cells. Transplantation of SB-treated human islets into diabetic immune-deficient mice resulted in significant improvement in blood glucose control, significantly higher serum and graft insulin content, and significantly greater increases in $\beta$-cell proliferation in the graft, compared with controls. Thus, our data suggest that transient suppression of TGF$\beta$ receptor signaling may improve the outcome of human islet transplantation, seemingly through increasing $\beta$-cell number and function.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, transcription factors (TFs) are thought to act in a combinatorial way, by competing and collaborating to regulate common target genes. However, several questions remain regarding the conservation of these combinations among different gene classes, regulatory regions and cell types. We propose a new approach named TFcoop to infer the TF combinations involved in the binding of a target TF in a particular cell type. TFcoop aims to predict the binding sites of the target TF upon the binding affinity of all identified cooperating TFs. The set of cooperating TFs and model parameters are learned from ChIP-seq data of the target TF. We used TFcoop to investigate the TF combinations involved in the binding of 106 TFs on 41 cell types and in four regulatory regions: promoters of mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs, and enhancers. We first assess that TFcoop is accurate and outperforms simple PWM methods for predicting TF binding sites. Next, analysis of the learned models sheds light on important properties of TF combinations in different promoter classes and in enhancers. First, we show that combinations governing TF binding on enhancers are more cell-type specific than that governing binding in promoters. Second, for a given TF and cell type, we observe that TF combinations are different between promoters and enhancers, but similar for promoters of mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs. Analysis of the TFs cooperating with the different targets show over-representation of pioneer TFs and a clear preference for TFs with binding motif composition similar to that of the target. Lastly, our models accurately distinguish promoters associated with specific biological processes.},

abstract = {High-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), a member of the high mobility group family, has been reported to correlate with cancer progression. However, there is no report concerning the correlation between HMGA2 and metastasis in renal cell carcinoma. In the present study, we found that HMGA2 was highly expressed in five renal cell carcinoma cell lines compared with that in the normal renal tubular epithelial HK2 cell line. Additionally, HMGA2 facilitated cell migration and invasion of renal cell carcinoma cells, as evidenced by wound healing and Transwell assays. Subsequently, our results revealed that the E‑cadherin level was upregulated, while N‑cadherin, Twist1 and Twist2 expression were downregulated in HMGA2-depleted ACHN cells. In contrast, overexpression of HMGA2 in 786‑O cells enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, analysis of the database Cancer Browser further validated the positive correlation between HGMA2 and Twist1 or Twist2 in renal cell carcinoma. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that low HMGA2 expression was closely associated with an increased overall survival in renal cell carcinoma patients. To confirm the underlying mechanism of HMGA2-regulated EMT, our results revealed that silencing of HMGA2 downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of TGF-$\beta$ and Smad2, while HMGA2 overexpression had the opposite effect. Furthermore, TGF-$\beta$ overexpression could partially reverse the anti-metastatic effect and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) by HMGA2 loss, while TGF-$\beta$ deficiency impeded the pro‑metastatic phenotype and high expression of EMT markers induced by HMGA2 overexpression. In summary, our results demonstrated that HMGA2 facilitated a metastatic phenotype and the EMT process in renal cell carcinoma cells in vitro through a TGF-$\beta$-dependent pathway. In addition, these data strongly suggest that HGMA2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker against renal cell carcinoma in the future.},

abstract = {Better understanding the mechanisms underlying adipogenesis may provide novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of obesity. Most studies investigating the mechanisms underlying adipogenesis focus on highly regulated transcriptional pathways; little is known about the epigenetic mechanisms in this process. Here, we determined the role of DNA methylation in regulating 3T3-L1 adipogenesis in early and late stage of differentiation. We found that inhibiting DNA methylation pharmacologically by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) at early stage of 3T3-L1 differentiation markedly suppressed adipogenesis. This inhibition of adipogenesis by 5-aza-dC was associated with up-regulation of Wnt10a, an antiadipogenic factor, and down-regulation of Wnt10a promoter methylation. In contrast, inhibiting DNA methylation by 5-aza-dC at late stage of differentiation enhanced the lipogenic program. The differential effects of 5-aza-dC on adipogenesis were confirmed by gain or loss of function of DNA methyltransferase 1 using genetic approaches. We further explored the molecular mechanism underlying the enhanced lipogenesis by inhibition of DNA methylation at late stage of differentiation. The Srebp1c promoter is enriched with CpG sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that DNA methyltransferase 1 bound to the methylation region at the Srebp1c promoter. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that the DNA methylation at the key cis-elements of the Srebp1c promoter was downregulated in adipogenesis. Further, luciferase reporter assays showed that the Srebp1c promoter activity was dramatically up-regulated by the unmethylated promoter compared with the fully methylated promoter. Thus DNA methylation appears to exert a biphasic regulatory role in adipogenesis, promoting differentiation at early stage while inhibiting lipogenesis at late stage of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) has a highly diverse range of biological functions from physiological signaling and maintenance of homeostasis to serving as an effector molecule in the immune system. However, deleterious as well as beneficial roles of NO have been reported. Many of the dichotomous effects of NO and derivative reactive nitrogen species (RNS) can be explained by invoking precise interactions with different targets as a result of concentration and temporal constraints. Endogenous concentrations of NO span five orders of magnitude, with levels near the high picomolar range typically occurring in short bursts as compared to sustained production of low micromolar levels of NO during immune response. This article provides an overview of the redox landscape as it relates to increasing NO concentrations, which incrementally govern physiological signaling, nitrosative signaling and nitrosative stress-related signaling. Physiological signaling by NO primarily occurs upon interaction with the heme protein soluble guanylyl cyclase. As NO concentrations rise, interactions with nonheme iron complexes as well as indirect modification of thiols can stimulate additional signaling processes. At the highest levels of NO, production of a broader range of RNS, which subsequently interact with more diverse targets, can lead to chemical stress. However, even under such conditions, there is evidence that stress-related signaling mechanisms are triggered to protect cells or even resolve the stress. This review therefore also addresses the fundamental reactions and kinetics that initiate signaling through NO-dependent pathways, including processes that lead to interconversion of RNS and interactions with molecular targets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND PHD-finger domain protein 5A (PHF5A) is a highly conserved small transcriptional regulator also involved in pre-mRNA splicing; however, its biological functions and molecular mechanisms in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the functional relevance and therapeutic potential of PHF5A in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). METHODS The expression of PHF5A in LAC tissues and adjacent non-tumor (ANT) tissues was investigated using immunohistochemistry of a tissue microarray, qRT-PCR, western blot and bioinformatics. The function of PHF5A was determined using several in vitro assays and also in vivo assay by lentiviral vector-mediated PHF5A depletion in LAC cell lines. RESULTS PHF5A was highly upregulated in LAC tissues compared with the ANT counterparts, and closely associated with tumor progression and poor patient prognosis. These results were further confirmed by findings of the TCGA database. Moreover, functional studies demonstrated that PHF5A knockdown not only resulted in reduced cell proliferation, increased cell apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, but also suppressed migration and invasion in LAC cells. PHF5A silencing was also found to inhibit LAC tumor growth in nude mice. Microarray and bioinformatics analyses revealed that PHF5A depletion led to dysregulation of multiple tumor signaling pathways; selected factors in key signaling pathways were verified in vitro. CONCLUSIONS The data suggest for the first time that PHF5A is an oncoprotein that contributes to LAC progression by regulating multiple signaling pathways, and may constitute a prognostic factor and potential new therapeutic target in NSCLC.},

abstract = {WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The behavioural approach is usually slow and not always sufficient to achieve optimal targets in weight and metabolic control in obese diabetic patients, and a pharmacological treatment is often necessary. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of orlistat and placebo on body weight, glycaemic and lipid profile and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-four obese, diabetic patients were enrolled in this study and randomized to take orlistat 360mg or placebo for 1year. We evaluated at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12months body weight, waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c) ), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), lipid profile, retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP-4), resistin, visfatin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We observed a significant reduction in body weight, WC, BMI, lipid profile, RBP-4 and visfatin in the orlistat group but not in control group. Faster improvements in HbA(1c) , PPG, FPI, HOMA-IR, resistin and Hs-CRP were recorded with orlistat than with placebo. A similar decrease in FPG was seen in the two groups. Significant predictors of change in insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were RBP-4 and resistin concentration in the orlistat group (r=-0.53, P{\textless}0.05, and r=-0.59, P{\textless}0.01, respectively). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the effect of orlistat on insulin resistance and markers of inflammation. Orlistat improved lipid profile and led to faster glycaemic control and insulin resistance parameters than the control, without any serious adverse event. Orlistat also improved RBP-4 and visfatin, effects not observed with placebo.},

Conversely, autophagy is inhibited by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a central cell-growth regulator that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals. Here we demonstrate a molecular mechanism for regulation of the mammalian autophagy-initiating kinase Ulk1, a homologue of yeast ATG1. Under glucose starvation, AMPK promotes autophagy by directly activating Ulk1 through phosphorylation of Ser 317 and Ser 777. Under nutrient sufficiency, high mTOR activity prevents Ulk1 activation by phosphorylating Ulk1 Ser 757 and disrupting the interaction between Ulk1 and AMPK. This coordinated phosphorylation is important for Ulk1 in autophagy induction. Our study has revealed a signalling mechanism for Ulk1 regulation and autophagy induction in response to nutrient signalling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly diverse group that is associated with an aggressive phenotype. Its treatment has been challenging due to its heterogeneity and absence of well-defined molecular targets. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel agents with therapeutic application. NF-$\kappa$B is over-expressed in many breast cancers; thus, inactivation of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway could serve as a therapeutic target. Here we report for the first time the anti-tumor activity of panepoxydone (PP), a NF-$\kappa$B inhibitor isolated from an edible mushroom, in several breast cancer cell lines.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We investigated the effects of PP on cell growth, migration-invasion, apoptosis and EMT-related proteins expression in MCF-7 and TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Significant antitumor activity was seen in all cell lines, with differential responses noted in cell-line specific manner. Treatment with PP resulted in significant cytotoxicity, decreased invasion, migration and increased apoptosis in all cell lines tested. Up-regulation of Bax and cleaved PARP and down-regulation of Bcl-2, survivin, cyclin D1 and caspase 3 were noted in PP-treated breast cancer cells. The antitumor effect of PP appeared related to its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-$\kappa$B (I$\kappa$B$\alpha$) with cytoplasmic accumulation. PP treatment also down-regulated FOXM1 which resulted in a reversal of EMT. Similar results were obtained after silencing of NF-kB and FOXM1.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Altogether, these studies show, for the first time the antitumor activity of PP against breast cancer cells, in particular TNBC cells. Furthermore, it highlights the concept that optimal treatment of TNBC warrants attention to the differential sensitivity of various TNBC subtypes to therapeutic agents. These results suggest that the PP may be a potentially effective chemopreventive or therapeutic agent against breast cancer. However, additional studies are required to more fully elucidate the mechanism of antitumor effect of PP.},

abstract = {S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous nitric oxide (NO) carrier that plays a critical role in redox based NO signaling. Recent studies have reported that GSNO regulates the activities of STAT3 and NF-$\kappa$B via S-nitrosylation dependent mechanisms. Since STAT3 and NF-$\kappa$B are key transcription factors involved in tumor progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis of head and neck cancer, we investigated the effect of GSNO in cell culture and mouse xenograft models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). For the cell culture studies, three HNSCC cell lines were tested (SCC1, SCC14a and SCC22a). All three cell lines had constitutively activated (phosphorylated) STAT3 (Tyr705). GSNO treatment of these cell lines reversibly decreased the STAT3 phosphorylation in a concentration dependent manner. GSNO treatment also decreased the basal and cytokine-stimulated activation of NF-$\kappa$B in SCC14a cells and reduced the basal low degree of nitrotyrosine by inhibition of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression. The reduced STAT3/NF-$\kappa$B activity by GSNO treatment was correlated with the decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis of HNSCC cells. In HNSCC mouse xenograft model, the tumor growth was reduced by systemic treatment with GSNO and was further reduced when the treatment was combined with radiation and cisplatin. Accordingly, GSNO treatment also resulted in decreased levels of phosphorylated STAT3. In summary, these studies demonstrate that GSNO treatment blocks the NF-$\kappa$B and STAT3 pathways which are responsible for cell survival, proliferation and that GSNO mediated mechanisms complement cispaltin and radiation therapy, and thus could potentiate the therapeutic effect in HNSCC.},

abstract = {Tumorigenic transformation of human epithelial cells in vitro has been described experimentally as the potential result of spontaneous immortalization. This process is characterized by a series of cell–state transitions, in which normal epithelial cells acquire first a senescent state which is later surpassed to attain a mesenchymal stem–like phenotype with a potentially tumorigenic behavior. In this paper we aim to provide a system–level mechanistic explanation to the emergence of these cell types, and to the time–ordered transition patterns that are common to neoplasias of epithelial origin. To this end, we first integrate published functional and well–curated molecular data of the components and interactions that have been found to be involved in such cell states and transitions into a network of 41 molecular components. We then reduce this initial network by removing simple mediators (i.e., linear pathways), and formalize the resulting regulatory core into logical rules that govern the dynamics of each of the network components as a function of the states of its regulators. Computational dynamic analysis shows that our proposed Gene Regulatory Network model recovers exactly three attractors, each of them defined by a specific gene expression profile that corresponds to the epithelial, senescent, and mesenchymal stem–like cellular phenotypes, respectively. We show that although a mesenchymal stem–like state can be attained even under unperturbed physiological conditions, the likelihood of converging to this state is increased when pro–inflammatory conditions are simulated, providing a systems–level mechanistic explanation for the carcinogenic role of chronic inflammatory conditions observed in the clinic. We also found that the regulatory core yields an epigenetic landscape that restricts temporal patterns of progression between the steady states, such that recovered patterns resemble the time–ordered transitions observed during the spontaneous immortalization of epithelial cells, both in vivo and in vitro. Our study strongly suggests that the in vitro tumorigenic transformation of epithelial cells, which strongly correlates with the patterns observed during the pathological progression of epithelial carcinogenesis in vivo, emerges from underlying regulatory networks involved in epithelial trans–differentiation during development.},

Here, we present Scribe, a toolkit for detecting and visualizing causal regulatory interactions between genes and explore the potential for single-cell experiments to power network reconstruction. Scribe employs Restricted Directed Information to determine causality by estimating the strength of information transferred from a potential regulator to its downstream target. We apply Scribe and other leading approaches for causal network reconstruction to several types of single-cell measurements and show that there is a dramatic drop in performance for "pseudotime" ordered single-cell data compared to true time series data. We demonstrate that performing causal inference requires temporal coupling between measurements. We show that methods such as "RNA velocity" restore some degree of coupling through an analysis of chromaffin cell fate commitment. These analyses therefore highlight an important shortcoming in experimental and computational methods for analyzing gene regulation at single-cell resolution and point the way towards overcoming it.},

abstract = {The Sineoculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1) protein has been found to be overexpressed in several human cancers. However, its expression pattern and biological roles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unexplored. This study examined the clinical significance of SIX1 in 119 ESCC tissues. It was found that SIX1 protein was upregulated in 36.9{\%} (44/119) cases. SIX1 overexpression was an independent predictor for short survival of ESCC patients. siRNA knockdown and plasmid transfection were carried out in ESCC cell lines. SIX1 depletion inhibited cell growth, invasion, and colony formation, whereas its overexpression facilitated in vivo and in vitro cell growth, invasion, and colony formation. The apoptosis rate induced by X-ray irradiation was substantially increased by SIX1 knockdown in Eca-109 cells. Ectopic overexpression of SIX1 in TE-1 cells dramatically enhanced resistance to irradiation. Western blot analysis showed that SIX1 depletion downregulated cyclin E, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), Bcl-2 expression and upregulated Bim expression. SIX1 overexpression exhibited the opposite effect on these proteins. In addition, it was found that SIX1 could positively regulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT signaling pathway. ERK inhibitor abolished the effect of SIX1 on MMP-2 expression. AKT inhibitor treatment blocked the role of SIX1 on anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SIX1 overexpression predicts poor survival in ESCC patients and confers radioresistance through activation of AKT signaling pathways.},

Compared to other lipophilic dyes, Nile Red uptake effectively distinguished adipocyte populations. Nile Red fluorescence increased with adipocyte size and granularity and could be combined with MitoTracker{\textregistered} Deep Red or fluorescent antibody labeling to further dissect adipose populations. Epicardial adipocytes exhibited the least mitochondrial membrane depolarization and highest fatty-acid translocase CD36 surface expression. In contrast, brown adipocytes showed low surface CD36 expression. Pregnancy resulted in reduced mitochondrial membrane depolarisation and increased CD36 surface expression in brown and epicardial adipocyte populations respectively.

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms and genetic programs required for cancer metastasis are sometimes overlapping, but components are clearly distinct from those promoting growth of a primary tumor. Every sequential, rate-limiting step in the sequence of events leading to metastasis requires coordinated expression of multiple genes, necessary signaling events, and favorable environmental conditions or the ability to escape negative selection pressures. Metastasis suppressors are molecules that inhibit the process of metastasis without preventing growth of the primary tumor. The cellular processes regulated by metastasis suppressors are diverse and function at every step in the metastatic cascade. As we gain knowledge into the molecular mechanisms of metastasis suppressors and cofactors with which they interact, we learn more about the process, including appreciation that some are potential targets for therapy of metastasis, the most lethal aspect of cancer. Until now, metastasis suppressors have been described largely by their function. With greater appreciation of their biochemical mechanisms of action, the importance of context is increasingly recognized especially since tumor cells exist in myriad microenvironments. In this chapter, we assemble the evidence that selected molecules are indeed suppressors of metastasis, collate the data defining the biochemical mechanisms of action, and glean insights regarding how metastasis suppressors regulate tumor cell communication to-from microenvironments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Stromal proteomes were coordinately regulated; however, the sets of proteins altered by each tumor were highly distinct. Integrated analysis of tumor and stromal proteins, a comparison made possible in these xenograft models, indicated that the known hallmarks of cancer contribute pleiotropically to establishing and maintaining the microenvironmental niche of the tumor.

Mesenchymal phenotypes observed in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}BRMS1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}KD{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} cells are dependent on RelA/p65, the transcriptionally active subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B).

At a global level, these regulatory networks display a scale-free topology, indicating the presence of regulatory hubs. At a local level, substructures such as motifs and modules can be discerned in these networks. Despite the general organisational similarity of networks across the phylogenetic spectrum, there are interesting qualitative differences among the network components, such as the transcription factors. Although the DNA-binding domains of the transcription factors encoded by a given organism are drawn from a small set of ancient conserved superfamilies, their relative abundance often shows dramatic variation among different phylogenetic groups. Large portions of these networks appear to have evolved through extensive duplication of transcription factors and targets, often with inheritance of regulatory interactions from the ancestral gene. Interactions are conserved to varying degrees among genomes. Insights from the structure and evolution of these networks can be translated into predictions and used for engineering of the regulatory networks of different organisms.},

Senescent cells negatively affect their surrounding tissue by losing their cell specific functionality and by secreting a pro-tumorigenic and pro-inflammatory mixture of growth hormones, chemokines, cytokines and proteases, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Here we identified an extract from the plant Solidago virgaurea subsp. alpestris, which exhibited weak senolytic activity, delayed the acquisition of a senescent phenotype and induced a papillary phenotype with improved functionality in human dermal fibroblasts. When administered to stress-induced premature senescent fibroblasts, this extract changed their global mRNA expression profile and particularly reduced the expression of various SASP components, thereby ameliorating the negative influence on nearby cells. Thus, the investigated plant extract represents a promising possibility to block age-related loss of tissue functionality.},

After prostate cancer has become hormone independent, which often occurs after hormonal ablation therapies, it is difficult to effectively treat. Prostate cancer may arise from mutations and dysregulation of various genes involved in regulation signal transduction (e.g., PTEN, Akt, etc) and the cell cycle (e.g., p53, p21Cip1, p27Kip1, Rb, etc.). This review focuses on the aberrant interactions of signal transduction and cell cycle genes products and how they can contribute to prostate cancer and alter therapeutic effectiveness.},

HISAT uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of ∼64,000 bp. Tests on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.},

abstract = {Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) display anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenases and blocking prostaglandin production. Previous studies, however, suggested that some NSAIDs also modulate peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), raising the possibility that such off target effects contribute to the spectrum of clinically relevant NSAID actions. In this study, we set out to understand how peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-$\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$/PPARG) interacts with NSAIDs using X-ray crystallography and to relate ligand binding modes to effects on receptor activity. We find that several NSAIDs (sulindac sulfide, diclofenac, indomethacin and ibuprofen) bind PPAR$\gamma$ and modulate PPAR$\gamma$ activity at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Diclofenac acts as a partial agonist and binds to the PPAR$\gamma$ ligand binding pocket (LBP) in typical partial agonist mode, near the $\beta$-sheets and helix 3. By contrast, two copies of indomethacin and sulindac sulfide bind the LBP and, in aggregate, these ligands engage in LBP contacts that resemble agonists. Accordingly, both compounds, and ibuprofen, act as strong partial agonists. Assessment of NSAID activities in PPAR$\gamma$-dependent 3T3-L1 cells reveals that NSAIDs display adipogenic activities and exclusively regulate PPAR$\gamma$-dependent target genes in a manner that is consistent with their observed binding modes. Further, PPAR$\gamma$ knockdown eliminates indomethacin activities at selected endogenous genes, confirming receptor-dependence of observed effects. We propose that it is important to consider how individual NSAIDs interact with PPAR$\gamma$ to understand their activities, and that it will be interesting to determine whether high dose NSAID therapies result in PPAR activation.},

abstract = {Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of $\alpha$-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is dependent on $\alpha$-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant $\alpha$-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of $\alpha$-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC- 17 and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17- knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing cells. Finally,we showthat katanin, a microtubule-severing proteinwith enhanced activity on acetylated $\alpha$-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of $\alpha$-tubulin acetylation initiates cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting $\alpha$-tubulin severing by katanin which, in turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological transition toward mature adipocytes. {\textcopyright} The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2013 Biochemical Society.},

Several robust techniques have been developed to dissect the composition of such mixed samples given transcriptional signatures of the pure components or their proportions. These approaches are insufficient, however, in situations when no information about individual mixture components is available. This problem is known as the complete deconvolution problem, where the composition is revealed without any a priori knowledge about cell types and their proportions. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized property of tissue-specific genes – their mutual linearity – and use it to reveal the structure of the topological space of mixed transcriptional profiles and provide a noise-robust approach to the complete deconvolution problem. Furthermore, our analysis reveals systematic bias of all deconvolution techniques due to differences in cell size or RNA-content, and we demonstrate how to address this bias at the experimental design level.},

Apart from collecting and reassessing available experimental data on protein–protein interactions, and importing known pathways and protein complexes from curated databases, interaction predictions are derived from the following sources: (i) systematic co-expression analysis, (ii) detection of shared selective signals across genomes, (iii) automated text-mining of the scientific literature and (iv) computational transfer of interaction knowledge between organisms based on gene orthology. In the latest version 10.5 of STRING, the biggest changes are concerned with data dissemination: the web frontend has been completely redesigned to reduce dependency on outdated browser technologies, and the database can now also be queried from inside the popular Cytoscape software framework.

In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications.

Parkin and PINK1, gene products mutated in familial Parkinson's disease, play essential roles in mitophagy through ubiquitination of mitochondria. Cargo ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin is important to trigger selective autophagy. Although autophagy receptors recruit LC3-labeled autophagic membranes onto damaged mitochondria, how other essential autophagy units such as ATG9A-integrated vesicles are recruited remains unclear. Here, using mammalian cultured cells, we demonstrate that RABGEF1, the upstream factor of the endosomal Rab GTPase cascade, is recruited to damaged mitochondria via ubiquitin binding downstream of Parkin. RABGEF1 directs the downstream Rab proteins, RAB5 and RAB7A, to damaged mitochondria, whose associations are further regulated by mitochondrial Rab-GAPs. Furthermore, depletion of RAB7A inhibited ATG9A vesicle assembly and subsequent encapsulation of the mitochondria by autophagic membranes. These results strongly suggest that endosomal Rab cycles on damaged mitochondria are a crucial regulator of mitophagy through assembling ATG9A vesicles.},

Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) has been estimated to account for {\~{}}7{\%} of all cases of NBIA and has distinctive clinical and brain imaging findings. Heterozygous variants in the WDR45 gene located in Xp11.23 are responsible for BPAN. A clear female predominance supports an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance with proposed lethality for germline variants in hemizygous males. By whole-exome sequencing, we identified an in-frame deletion in the WDR45 gene (c.161{\_}163delTGG) in the hemizygous state in a 20-year-old man with a history of profound neurocognitive impairment and seizures. His higher functioning 14-year-old sister, also with a history of intellectual disability, was found to carry the same variant in the heterozygous state. Their asymptomatic mother was mosaic for the alteration. From this pair of siblings with BPAN we conclude that: (1) inherited WDR45 variants are possible, albeit rare; (2) hemizygous germline variants in males can be viable, but likely result in a more severe phenotype; (3) for siblings with germline variants, males should be more significantly affected than females; and (4) because gonadal and germline mosaicism are possible and healthy female carriers can be found, parental testing for variants in WDR45 should be considered.},

abstract = {Solid tumor samples typically contain multiple distinct clonal populations of cancer cells, and also stromal and immune cell contamination. A majority of the cancer genomics and transcriptomics studies do not explicitly consider genetic heterogeneity and impurity, and draw inferences based on mixed populations of cells. Deconvolution of genomic data from heterogeneous samples provides a powerful tool to address this limitation.We discuss several computational tools, which enable deconvolution of genomic and transcriptomic data from heterogeneous samples. We also performed a systematic comparative assessment of these tools. If properly used, these tools have potentials to complement single-cell genomics and immunoFISH analyses, and provide novel insights into tumor heterogeneity.},

abstract = {The heterochronic gene let-7 serves as a tumor suppressor microRNA by targeting various oncogenic pathways in cancer cells. Considerable evidence indicates that reduced expression of let-7 might be associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with cancer. Here, we report that the expression levels of three let-7 family members, let-7a, let-7b, and let-7g, were significantly decreased in the patients with breast cancer with lymph node metastasis compared with those without lymph node metastasis. Enforced expression of let-7b significantly inhibits breast cancer cell motility and affects actin dynamics. Using bioinformatic and experimental approaches, four genes in the actin cytoskeleton pathway, including PAK1, DIAPH2, RDX, and ITGB8, were identified as let-7 direct targets. Blocking the expression of PAK1, DIAPH2, and RDX significantly inhibits breast cancer cell migration induced by let-7b repression. Our results indicate that reconstitution of let-7 expression in tumor cells could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metastatic disease.},

abstract = {Objective: This study was a randomized placebo-controlled trial testing the addition of orlistat to behavioral weight loss for obesity in Spanish-speaking-only Latino/as with versus without binge eating disorder (BED) performed at a community mental health center serving educationally- and economically-disadvantaged patients. Latino/as have high rates of obesity but are under-represented in obesity treatment studies and despite comparable-to-or-higher rates of BED than Whites, Latino/as are under-represented in BED treatment studies. BED is associated with obesity but whether it predicts/moderates treatment outcomes remains uncertain. Thus, this study also tested whether BED prospectively predicts/moderates outcomes. Methods: Seventy-nine obese Spanish-speaking-only Latino/as with BED (N = 40) versus without BED (N = 39) at a community mental health center were randomly assigned to four-months of orlistat-plus-BWL or placebo-plus-BWL. BWL was culturally-enhanced modification of Diabetes-Prevention-Program delivered in weekly sessions in Spanish. Orlistat (120 mg tid) and matching-placebo delivered with standard clinical-management. Participants were assessed independently throughout treatment, post-treatment, and six-month follow-up. Results: 78{\%} completed treatments; completion rates did not differ significantly by medication or BED. Intent-to-treat mixed-models analyses revealed significant improvements in binge eating, eating-psychopathology, and depression, and significant - albeit modest - weight-loss. Overall, the addition of orlistat to BWL was not associated with greater improvements; however, BED moderated weight-loss: orlistat-plus-BWL produced significantly greater weight-loss in non-BED group but not in BED. Improvements were maintained through 6-month follow-up; BED significantly predicted/moderated increases in eating concerns and depression following treatment. Within BED-group, binge-eating remission rates were 65{\%} (post-treatment) and 50{\%} (follow-up). Conclusions: In this controlled trial performed at community mental health center serving educationally- and economically-disadvantaged Spanish-speaking-only Latino/as with co-morbid psychiatric needs, we observed outcomes for the BWL plus orlistat/placebo medication that approximate or are slightly dampened relative to the literature for efficacy trials with much more restrictive obese and BED samples. In this complex patient group, adding orlistat to BWL produced greater weight-loss than adding placebo among obese patients without BED but not among those with BED. Although 50{\%} of BED patients maintained abstinence from binge-eating following these specific obesity treatments (BWL plus orlistat/placebo), BED was a negative prognostic indicator for some outcome variables.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00516919. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Adipocyte differentiation is a coordinated cellular process, which involves a series of dynamic molecular events. Up-regulation of long noncoding RNA slincRAD expression was found to occur in the early differentiation stages of 3T3-L1 cell, prior to the regulation of major transcription factors. By interacting with DNMT1 in S phase, slincRAD guides this essentially epigenetic factor to mediate promoter methylation of a batch of cell cycle-related genes, including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. The regulation promotes the growth-arrested cells to re-enter into cell cycle under hormone induction and thereby advances the process of differentiation to clonal expansion stage. The abolishment of the interaction between slincRAD and DNMT1 by slincRAD knockdown results in a defective epigenetic regulation and finally compromised adipogenesis. Collectively, our study characterizes the epigenetic regulation of lncRNA involved in the early stage of adipogenesis.},

abstract = {Proteins controlling cellular networks have evolved distinct mechanisms to ensure specificity in protein-protein interactions. Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is a multifaceted kinase modulator, but it is not well understood how this small protein (21 kDa) can coordinate its diverse signaling functions. Raf1 and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 2 are direct interaction partners of RKIP and thus provide the possibility to untangle the mechanism of its target specificity. Here, we identify RKIP dimer formation as an important mechanistic feature in the target switch from Raf1 to GRK2. Co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments revealed RKIP dimerization upon phosphorylation of RKIP at serine 153 utilizing purified proteins as well as in cells overexpressing RKIP. A functional phosphomimetic RKIP mutant had a high propensity for dimerization and reproduced the switch from Raf1 to GRK2. RKIP dimerization and GRK2 binding, but not Raf1 interaction, were prevented by a peptide comprising amino acids 127-146 of RKIP, which suggests that this region is critical for dimer formation. Furthermore, a dimeric RKIP mutant displayed a higher affinity to GRK2, but a lower affinity to Raf1. Functional analyses of phosphomimetic as well as dimeric RKIP demonstrated that enhanced dimerization of RKIP translates into decreased Raf1 and increased GRK2 inhibition. The detection of RKIP dimers in a complex with GRK2 in murine hearts implies their physiological relevance. These findings represent a novel mechanistic feature how RKIP can discriminate between its different interaction partners and thus advances our understanding how specific inhibition of kinases can be achieved.},

abstract = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) against cancer has gained attention due to the successful outcome in some cancers, particularly those on the skin. However, there have been limitations to PDT applications in deep cancers and, occasionally, PDT treatment resulted in tumor recurrence. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of PDT-induced cytotoxicity and cytoprotection should facilitate the development of better approaches to inhibit the cytoprotective effects and also augment PDT-mediated cytotoxicity. PDT treatment results in the induction of iNOS/NO in both the tumor and the microenvironment. The role of NO in cytotoxicity and cytoprotection was examined. The findings revealed that NO mediates its effects by interfering with a dysregulated pro-survival/anti-apoptotic NF-$\kappa$B/Snail/YY1/RKIP loop which is often expressed in cancer cells. The cytoprotective effect of PDT-induced NO was the result of low levels of NO that activates the pro-survival/anti-apoptotic NF-$\kappa$B, Snail, and YY1 and inhibits the anti-survival/pro-apoptotic and metastasis suppressor RKIP. In contrast, PDT-induced high levels of NO result in the inhibition of NF-kB, Snail, and YY1 and the induction of RKIP, all of which result in significant anti-tumor cytotoxicity. The direct role of PDT-induced NO effects was corroborated by the use of the NO inhibitor, l-NAME, which reversed the PDT-mediated cytotoxic and cytoprotective effects. In addition, the combination of the NO donor, DETANONOate, and PDT potentiated the PDT-mediated cytotoxic effects. These findings revealed a new mechanism of PDT-induced NO effects and suggested the potential therapeutic application of the combination of NO donors/iNOS inducers and PDT in the treatment of various cancers. In addition, the study suggested that the combination of PDT with subtoxic cytotoxic drugs will result in significant synergy since NO has been shown to be a significant chemo-immunosensitizing agent to apoptosis.},

abstract = {Aberrant activation or disruption of autophagy promotes tumorigenesis in various preclinical models of cancer, but whether the autophagy pathway is a target for recurrent molecular alteration in human cancer patient samples is unknown. To address this outstanding question, we surveyed 211 human autophagy-associated genes for tumor-related alterations to DNA sequence and RNA expression levels and examined their association with patient survival outcomes in multiple cancer types with sequence data from The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium. We found 3 (RB1CC1/FIP200, ULK4, WDR45/WIPI4) and one (ATG7) core autophagy genes to be under positive selection for somatic mutations in endometrial carcinoma and clear cell renal carcinoma, respectively; while 29 autophagy regulators and pathway interactors, including previously identified KEAP1, NFE2L2 and MTOR, were significantly mutated in 6 of the 11 cancer types examined. Gene expression analyses revealed that GABARAPL1 and MAP1LC3C/LC3C transcripts were less abundant in breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancers than in matched normal tissue controls; ATG4D transcripts were increased in lung squamous cell carcinoma, as were ATG16L2 transcripts in kidney cancer. Unsupervised clustering of autophagy-associated mRNA levels in tumors stratified patient overall survival in 3 of 9 cancer types (acute myeloid leukemia, clear cell renal carcinoma, and head and neck cancer). These analyses provide the first comprehensive resource of recurrently altered autophagy-associated genes in human tumors, and highlight cancer types and subtypes where perturbed autophagy may be relevant to patient overall survival.},

This review provides an overview of factors involved in the proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes. A brief review of the numerous factors that influence PPAR$\gamma$, the transcription factor thought to be the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, provides context of established pathways that regulate adipogenesis. Thought provoking findings from research with hypoxia that is supported by earlier research that vascular development is related to adipogenesis are reviewed. Finally, our understanding of the critical role of the ECM and environment in adipogenesis is discussed and compared with studies that suggest that adipocytes may dedifferentiate and can convert into other cell types.},

abstract = {With the effectiveness of therapeutic agents ever decreasing and the increased incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, there is a clear need for administration of more potent, potentially more toxic, drugs. Alternatively, biopharmaceuticals may hold potential but require specialised protection from premature in vivo degradation. Thus, a paralleled need for specialised drug delivery systems has arisen. Although cell-mediated drug delivery is not a completely novel concept, the few applications described to date are not yet ready for in vivo application, for various reasons such as drug-induced carrier cell death, limited control over the site and timing of drug release and/or drug degradation by the host immune system. Here, we present our hypothesis for a new drug delivery system, which aims to negate these limitations. We propose transport of nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs inside autologous macrophages polarised to M1 phenotype for high mobility and treated to induce transient phagosome maturation arrest. In addition, we propose a significant shift of existing paradigms in the study of host-microbe interactions, in order to study microbial host immune evasion and dissemination patterns for their therapeutic utilisation in the context of drug delivery. We describe a system in which microbial strategies may be adopted to facilitate absolute control over drug delivery, and without sacrificing the host carrier cells. We provide a comprehensive summary of the lessons we can learn from microbes in the context of drug delivery and discuss their feasibility for in vivo therapeutic application. We then describe our proposed “synthetic microbe drug delivery system” in detail. In our opinion, this multidisciplinary approach may hold the solution to effective, controlled drug delivery.},

abstract = {The ability to construct synthetic gene networks enables experimental investigations of deliberately simplified systems that can be compared to qualitative and quantitative models. If simple, well-characterized modules can be coupled together into more complex networks with behaviour that can be predicted from that of the individual components, we may begin to build an understanding of cellular regulatory processes from the 'bottom up'. Here we have engineered a promoter to allow simultaneous repression and activation of gene expression in Escherichia coli. We studied its behaviour in synthetic gene networks under increasingly complex conditions: unregulated, repressed, activated, and simultaneously repressed and activated. We develop a stochastic model that quantitatively captures the means and distributions of the expression from the engineered promoter of this modular system, and show that the model can be extended and used to accurately predict the in vivo behaviour of the network when it is expanded to include positive feedback. The model also reveals the counterintuitive prediction that noise in protein expression levels can increase upon arrest of cell growth and division, which we confirm experimentally. This work shows that the properties of regulatory subsystems can be used to predict the behaviour of larger, more complex regulatory networks, and that this bottom-up approach can provide insights into gene regulation.},

abstract = {In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p-values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as "informative covariates" to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigated the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology. Methods that incorporate informative covariates were modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and did not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate was completely uninformative. The majority of methods were successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we found the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increased with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disorder where insulin-sensitive tissues show reduced sensitivity towards insulin and a decreased glucose uptake (GU), which leads to hyperglycaemia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)$\gamma$ plays an important role in lipid and glucose homeostasis and is one of the targets in the discovery of drugs against T2D. Activation of PPAR$\gamma$ by agonists leads to a conformational change in the ligand-binding domain, a process that alters the transcription of several target genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Depending on the ligands, they can induce different sets of genes that depends of their recruitment of coactivators. The activation of PPAR$\gamma$ by full agonists such as the thiazolidinediones leads to improved insulin sensitivity but also to severe side effects probably due to their behavior as full agonists. Partial PPAR$\gamma$ agonists are compounds with diminished agonist efficacy compared to full agonist that may exhibit the same antidiabetic effect as full agonists without inducing the same magnitude of side effects. In this review, we describe a screening platform for the identification of partial PPAR$\gamma$ agonists from plant extracts that could be promising lead compounds for the development of antidiabetic drugs. The screening platform includes a series of in vitro bioassays, such as GU in adipocytes, PPAR$\gamma$-mediated transactivation, adipocyte differentiation and gene expression as well as in silico docking for partial PPAR$\gamma$ agonism.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Background: The genomic binding of CTCF is highly conserved across mammals, but the mechanisms that underlie its stability are poorly understood. One transcription factor known to functionally interact with CTCF in the context of X-chromosome inactivation is the ubiquitously expressed YY1. Because combinatorial transcription factor binding can contribute to the evolutionary stabilization of regulatory regions, we tested whether YY1 and CTCF co-binding could in part account for conservation of CTCF binding. Results: Combined analysis of CTCF and YY1 binding in lymphoblastoid cell lines from seven primates, as well as in mouse and human livers, reveals extensive genome-wide co-localization specifically at evolutionarily stable CTCF-bound regions. CTCF-YY1 co-bound regions resemble regions bound by YY1 alone, as they enrich for active histone marks, RNA polymerase II and transcription factor binding. Although these highly conserved, transcriptionally active CTCF-YY1 co-bound regions are often promoter-proximal, gene-distal regions show similar molecular features. Conclusions: Our results reveal that these two ubiquitously expressed, multi-functional zinc-finger proteins collaborate in functionally active regions to stabilize one another's genome-wide binding across primate evolution.},

abstract = {Cofactor squelching is the term used to describe competition between transcription factors (TFs) for a limited amount of cofactors in a cell with the functional consequence that TFs in a given cell interfere with the activity of each other. Since cofactor squelching was proposed based primarily on reporter assays some 30 years ago, it has remained controversial, and the idea that it could be a physiologically relevant mechanism for transcriptional repression has not received much support. However, recent genome-wide studies have demonstrated that signal-dependent TFs are very often absent from the enhancers that are acutely repressed by those signals, which is consistent with an indirect mechanism of repression such as squelching. Here we review these recent studies in the light of the classical studies of cofactor squelching, and we discuss how TF cooperativity in so-called hotspots and super-enhancers may sensitize these to cofactor squelching.},

BITC simultaneously activated the PI3K/Akt/forkhead box O (FoxO) pathway, whereas it significantly inhibited the proliferation in human colorectal cancer cells. Inhibitory experiments using a PI3K selective inhibitor, LY294002 or NVP-BEZ235, significantly enhanced the BITC-induced antiproliferation and apoptotic cell population with the attenuation of the BITC-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO survival pathway. Furthermore, BITC enhanced the insulin-activated PI3K/Akt/FoxO pathway, possibly through its inhibition of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B enzymatic activity. Taken together, these results suggested that the PI3K/Akt/FoxO pathway negatively regulates the BITC-induced antiproliferation in human colorectal cancer cells.},

In contrast, most oncogenes to date were characterized on the basis of mutations or by their constitutive overexpression. Study of NF-$\kappa$B actually leads to a far more dynamic perspective on cancer: tumors caused by diverse oncogenes apparently evolve into cancer after loss of feedback regulation for NF-$\kappa$B. This event alters the cellular phenotype and the expression of hormonal mediators, modifying signals between diverse cell types in a tissue.

abstract = {Here we present a technique called single-molecule high-resolution colocalization (SHREC) of fluorescent dyes that allows the measurement of interfluorophore distances in macromolecules and macromolecular complexes with better than 10-nm resolution. By using two chromatically differing fluorescent molecules as probes, we are able to circumvent the Rayleigh criterion and measure distances much smaller than 250 nm. The probes are imaged separately and localized individually with high precision. The registration between the two imaging channels is measured by using fiduciary markers, and the centers of the two probes are mapped onto the same space. Multiple measurements can be made before the fluorophores photobleach, allowing intramolecular and intermolecular distances to be tracked through time. This technique's lower resolution limit lies at the upper resolution limit of single molecule FRET (smFRET) microscopy. The instrumentation and fluorophores used for SHREC can also be used for smFRET, allowing the two types of measurements to be made interchangeably, covering a wide range of interfluorophore distances. A dual-labeled duplex DNA molecule (30 bp) was used as a 10-nm molecular ruler to confirm the validity of the method. We also used SHREC to study the motion of myosin V. We directly observed myosin V's alternating heads while it walked hand-over-hand along an actin filament.},

Among them, the human malignant melanoma cell A-375 was confirmed to be the most sensitive. Morphologic evaluation, apoptosis rate analysis, Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed penicitrinine A could significantly induce A-375 cell apoptosis by decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 and increasing the expression of Bax. Moreover, we investigated the anti-metastatic effects of penicitrinine A in A-375 cells by wound healing assay, trans-well assay, Western blot and RT-qPCR. The results showed penicitrinine A significantly suppressed metastatic activity of A-375 cells by regulating the expression of MMP-9 and its specific inhibitor TIMP-1. These findings suggested that penicitrinine A might serve as a potential antitumor agent, which could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells.},

abstract = {The role of Fat Mass and Obesity-associated protein (FTO) and its substrate N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA processing and adipogenesis remains largely unknown. We show that FTO expression and m6A levels are inversely correlated during adipogenesis. FTO depletion blocks differentiation and only catalytically active FTO restores adipogenesis. Transcriptome analyses in combination with m6A-seq revealed that gene expression and mRNA splicing of grouped genes are regulated by FTO. M6A is enriched in exonic regions flanking 5'- and 3'-splice sites, spatially overlapping with mRNA splicing regulatory serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein exonic splicing enhancer binding regions. Enhanced levels of m6A in response to FTO depletion promotes the RNA binding ability of SRSF2 protein, leading to increased inclusion of target exons. FTO controls exonic splicing of adipogenic regulatory factor RUNX1T1 by regulating m6A levels around splice sites and thereby modulates differentiation. These findings provide compelling evidence that FTO-dependent m6A demethylation functions as a novel regulatory mechanism of RNA processing and plays a critical role in the regulation of adipogenesis.},

We identify modules of coexpressed genes that correspond to discrete brain regions and quantify their conservation between the species. Module conservation in cerebral cortex is significantly weaker than module conservation in subcortical brain regions, revealing a striking gradient that parallels known evolutionary hierarchies. We introduce a method for identifying species-specific network connections and demonstrate how differential network connectivity can be used to identify key drivers of evolutionary change. By integrating our results with comparative genomic sequence data and estimates of protein sequence divergence rates, we confirm a number of network predictions and validate these findings.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

Originally implicated in melanoma metastasis, it has diverse cellular roles and is consistently identified as a regulator of tumor invasion and angiogenesis. As a potential target for inhibiting some of the most lethal aspects of cancer progression, further insight into the function of MDA-9/Syntenin is mandatory. Areas covered: Recent literature and seminal articles were reviewed to summarize the latest collective understanding of MDA-9/Syntenin's role in normal and cancerous settings. Insights into its participation in developmental processes are included, as is the functional significance of the N- and C-terminals and PDZ domains of MDA-9/Syntenin. Current reports highlight the clinical significance of MDA-9/Syntenin expression level in a variety of cancers, often correlating directly with reduced patient survival. Also presented are assessments of roles of MDA-9/Syntenin in cancer progression as well as its functions as an intracellular adapter molecule. Expert opinion: Multiple studies demonstrate the importance of MDA-9/Syntenin in tumor invasion and progression. Through the use of novel drug design approaches, this protein may provide a worthwhile therapeutic target. As many conventional therapies do not address, or even enhance, tumor invasion, an anti-invasive approach would be a worthwhile addition in cancer therapy.},

The analysis of brown and brite adipocytes is complicated by the complexity of adipose tissue biopsies. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of pure brown, brite, and white adipocyte transcriptomes. By combining mouse and human transcriptome data, we identify a gene signature that can classify brown and white adipocytes in mice and men. Using a machine-learning-based cell deconvolution approach, we develop an algorithm proficient in calculating the brown adipocyte content in complex human and mouse biopsies. Applying this algorithm, we can show in a human weight loss study that brown adipose tissue (BAT) content is associated with energy expenditure and the propensity to lose weight. This online available tool can be used for in-depth characterization of complex adipose tissue samples and may support the development of therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure in humans. By combining mouse and human transcriptome data, Perdikari et al. identify a gene signature that can classify brown and white adipocytes. Using a machine-learning-based cell deconvolution approach, they develop an algorithm proficient in calculating the brown adipocyte content in complex biopsies.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increased pulmonary vascular remodelling, pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance characterize the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Activation of the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 is thought to play an important role in PAH and Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), negatively regulates this pathway. This study investigated whether genetic deletion of RKIP (and hence ERK1/2 up-regulation) resulted in a pulmonary hypertensive phenotype in mice and investigated a role for RKIP in mitogen-regulated proliferative responses in lung fibroblasts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Pulmonary vascular haemodynamics and remodelling were assessed in mice genetically deficient in RKIP (RKIP-/-) after 2 weeks of either normoxia or hypoxia. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were used to examine phosphorylation of Raf-1, RKIP and ERK1/2 in mouse pulmonary arteries. In vitro, RKIP inhibition of mitogen signalling was analysed in CCL39 hamster lung fibroblasts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: RKIP-/- mice demonstrated elevated indices of PAH and ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Hypoxic RKIP-/- mice exhibited exaggerated PAH indices. Hypoxia increased phosphorylation of Raf-1, RKIP and ERK1/2 in WT mouse pulmonary arteries and Raf-1 phosphorylation in RKIP-/- mouse pulmonary arteries. In CCL39 cells, inhibition of RKIP potentiated mitogen-induced proliferation and phosphorylation of RKIP, and Raf-1.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The lack of RKIP protein resulted in a pulmonary hypertensive phenotype, exaggerated in hypoxia. Hypoxia induced phosphorylation of RKIP signalling elements in WT pulmonary arteries. RKIP inhibition potentiated mitogen-induced proliferation in lung fibroblasts. These results provide evidence for the involvement of RKIP in suppressing the development of hypoxia-induced PAH in mice.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) exert their regulatory action by binding to DNA with specific sequence preferences. However, different TFs can partially share their binding sequences due to their common evolutionary origin. This "redundancy" of binding defines a way of organizing TFs in "motif families" by grouping TFs with similar binding preferences. Since these ultimately define the TF target genes, the motif family organization entails information about the structure of transcriptional regulation as it has been shaped by evolution. Focusing on the human TF repertoire, we show that a one-parameter evolutionary model of the Birth-Death-Innovation type can explain the TF empirical repartition in motif families, and allows to highlight the relevant evolutionary forces at the origin of this organization. Moreover, the model allows to pinpoint few deviations from the neutral scenario it assumes: Three over-expanded families (including HOX and FOX genes), a set of "singleton" TFs for which duplication seems to be selected against, and a higher-than-average rate of diversification of the binding preferences of TFs with a Zinc Finger DNA binding domain. Finally, a comparison of the TF motif family organization in different eukaryotic species suggests an increase of redundancy of binding with organism complexity.},

abstract = {Multiple self-healing squamous epithelioma (MSSE) is a rare familial skin cancer in which multiple tumours resembling crateriform squamous carcinomas are locally invasive but regress spontaneously after several months, leaving deep disfiguring facial scars and shallower scars on the limbs. First identified in a number of Scottish families, the condition has since been reported more widely. We review here the investigations leading to the discovery of loss of function mutations in TGFBR1 that are responsible for the disease. Loss of heterozygosity in tumours reveals that TGFBR1 acts as a tumour suppressor gene. TGFBR1 was initially excluded as the MSSE gene because it lies outside an extensive chromosome 9 haplotype shared by Scottish families. MSSE can now be regarded as a digenic/multilocus disease in view of the evidence of a second linked locus necessary for pathogenesis located within the Scottish haplotype.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: HMLEs (HMLE-SNAIL and Kras-HMLE, Kras-HMLE-SNAIL pairs) serve as excellent model system to interrogate the effect of SNAIL targeted agents that reverse epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We had earlier developed a SNAIL-p53 interaction inhibitor (GN-25) that was shown to suppress SNAIL function. In this report, using systems biology and pathway network analysis, we show that GN-25 could cause reversal of EMT leading to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in a well-recognized HMLE-SNAIL and Kras-HMLE-SNAIL models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: GN-25 induced MET was found to be consistent with growth inhibition, suppression of spheroid forming capacity and induction of apoptosis. Pathway network analysis of mRNA expression using microarrays from GN-25 treated Kras-HMLE-SNAIL cells showed an orchestrated global re-organization of EMT network genes. The expression signatures were validated at the protein level (down-regulation of mesenchymal markers such as TWIST1 and TWIST2 that was concurrent with up-regulation of epithelial marker E-Cadherin), and RNAi studies validated SNAIL dependent mechanism of action of the drug. Most importantly, GN-25 modulated many major transcription factors (TFs) such as inhibition of oncogenic TFs Myc, TBX2, NR3C1 and led to enhancement in the expression of tumor suppressor TFs such as SMAD7, DD1T3, CEBPA, HOXA5, TFEB, IRF1, IRF7 and XBP1, resulting in MET as well as cell death.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our systems and network investigations provide convincing pre-clinical evidence in support of the clinical application of GN-25 for the reversal of EMT and thereby reducing cancer cell aggressiveness.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) combine with co-factors to form transcriptional regulatory modules (TRMs) that regulate gene expression programs with spatiotemporal specificity. Here we present a novel and generic method (rTRM) for the reconstruction of TRMs that integrates genomic information from TF binding, cell type-specific gene expression and protein-protein interactions. rTRM was applied to reconstruct the TRMs specific for embryonic stem cells (ESC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), neural progenitor cells, trophoblast stem cells and distinct types of terminally differentiated CD4(+) T cells. The ESC and HSC TRM predictions were highly precise, yielding 77 and 96 proteins, of which ∼75{\%} have been independently shown to be involved in the regulation of these cell types. Furthermore, rTRM successfully identified a large number of bridging proteins with known roles in ESCs and HSCs, which could not have been identified using genomic approaches alone, as they lack the ability to bind specific DNA sequences. This highlights the advantage of rTRM over other methods that ignore PPI information, as proteins need to interact with other proteins to form complexes and perform specific functions. The prediction and experimental validation of the co-factors that endow master regulatory TFs with the capacity to select specific genomic sites, modulate the local epigenetic profile and integrate multiple signals will provide important mechanistic insights not only into how such TFs operate, but also into abnormal transcriptional states leading to disease.},

RKIP is a known metastasis suppressor and interferes with several steps of metastasis. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of its function as a broad metastasis suppressor remain poorly understood. Here, we establish a novel pathway for RKIP regulation of metastasis inhibition through the negative regulation of RANTES/CCL5 thereby limiting tumor macrophage infiltration and inhibition of angiogenesis. Using a combination of loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we show that RKIP hinders breast cancer cell invasion by inhibiting expression of the CC chemokine CCL5 in vitro. We also show that the expression levels of RKIP and CCL5 are inversely correlated among clinical human breast cancer samples. Using a mouse allograft breast cancer transplantation model, we highlight that ectopic expression of RKIP significantly decreases tumor vasculature, macrophage infiltration and lung metastases. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the inhibition of the CCL5 expression is the cause of the observed effects resulting from RKIP expression. Taken together, our results underscore the significance of RKIP as important negative regulator of tumor microenvironment.},

Gene expression data (RNA-Seq) and miRNA expression data (Agilent Human miRNA Microarray V19.0) were generated. We focused on dysregulated genes with a fold change (FC) of {\textgreater} 1.50 or {\textless} 0.67, that were significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. miRNA:mRNA seed-region matches were determined. Twenty-three genes were significantly downregulated (FC {\textless} 0.67) and 18 were significantly upregulated (FC {\textgreater} 1.50). Of these 41 genes, 11 were significantly associated with miRNA differential expression. BIRC5 had the greatest number of miRNA associations (14) and the most miRNAs with a seed-region match (10). Four of these matches, miR-145-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-195-5p, and miR-650, had a negative beta coefficient. CSF2RB was associated with ten total miRNAs (five with a seed-region match, and one miRNA, miR-92a-3p, with a negative beta coefficient). Of the three miRNAs associated with CTSS, miR-20b-5p, and miR-501-3p, had a seed-region match and a negative beta coef-ficient between miRNA:mRNA pairs. Several miRNAs that were associated with dysregulated gene expression, seed-region matches, and negative beta coefficients also were associated with CRC-specific survival. Our data suggest that miRNAs could influence several apoptosis-related genes. BIRC5, CTSS, and CSF2R all had seed-region matches with miRNAs that would favor apoptosis. Our study identifies several miRNA associated with apoptosis-related genes, that if validated, could be important therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neuro-degenerative disruption of the brain which involves in large scale transcriptomic variation. The disease does not impact every regions of the brain at the same time, instead it progresses slowly involving somewhat sequential interaction with different regions. Analysis of the expression patterns of the genes in different regions of the brain influenced in AD surely contribute for a enhanced comprehension of AD pathogenesis and shed light on the early characterization of the disease. Here, we have proposed a framework to identify perturbation and preservation characteristics of gene expression patterns across six distinct regions of the brain (“EC”, “HIP”, “PC”, “MTG”, “SFG”, and “VCX”) affected in AD. Co-expression modules were discovered considering a couple of regions at once. These are then analyzed to know the preservation and perturbation characteristics. Different module preservation statistics and a rank aggregation mechanism have been adopted to detect the changes of expression patterns across brain regions. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway based analysis were also carried out to know the biological meaning of preserved and perturbed modules. In this article, we have extensively studied the preservation patterns of co-expressed modules in six distinct brain regions affected in AD. Some modules are emerged as the most preserved while some others are detected as perturbed between a pair of brain regions. Further investigation on the topological properties of preserved and non-preserved modules reveals a substantial association amongst “betweenness centrality” and ”degree” of the involved genes. Our findings may render a deeper realization of the preservation characteristics of gene expression patterns in discrete brain regions affected by AD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cellular functions are coordinately carried out by groups of genes forming functional modules. Identifying such modules in the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) of organisms is important for understanding the structure and function of these fundamental cellular networks and essential for the emerging modular biology. So far, the global connectivity structure of TRN has not been well studied and consequently not applied for the identification of functional modules. Moreover, network motifs such as feed forward loop are recently proposed to be basic building blocks of TRN. However, their relationship to functional modules is not clear. RESULTS: In this work we proposed a top-down approach to identify modules in the TRN of E. coli. By studying the global connectivity structure of the regulatory network, we first revealed a five-layer hierarchical structure in which all the regulatory relationships are downward. Based on this regulatory hierarchy, we developed a new method to decompose the regulatory network into functional modules and to identify global regulators governing multiple modules. As a result, 10 global regulators and 39 modules were identified and shown to have well defined functions. We then investigated the distribution and composition of the two basic network motifs (feed forward loop and bi-fan motif) in the hierarchical structure of TRN. We found that most of these network motifs include global regulators, indicating that these motifs are not basic building blocks of modules since modules should not contain global regulators. CONCLUSION: The transcriptional regulatory network of E. coli possesses a multi-layer hierarchical modular structure without feedback regulation at transcription level. This hierarchical structure builds the basis for a new and simple decomposition method which is suitable for the identification of functional modules and global regulators in the transcriptional regulatory network of E. coli. Analysis of the distribution of feed forward loops and bi-fan motifs in the hierarchical structure suggests that these network motifs are not elementary building blocks of functional modules in the transcriptional regulatory network of E. coli.},

We addressed the current understanding on the oncogenic role of EZH2, with an emphasis on: (1) the less known PRC2-independent role of EZH2 in gene activation, in addition to its canonical role in transcriptional silencing as a histone methyltransferase catalyzing the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27; (2) causes and consequences of its deregulation in tumor cells and; (3) collaboration of EZH2 with other epigenetic and hormone receptor-mediated oncogenic signaling pathways.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Mitochondrial stress response is essential for cell survival, and damaged mitochondria are a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, it is fundamental to understand how mitochondria relay information within the cell. Here, by investigating mitochondrial-endosomal contact sites we made the surprising observation that the small GTPase Rab5 translocates from early endosomes to mitochondria upon oxidative stress. This process is reversible and accompanied by an increase in Rab5-positive endosomes in contact with mitochondria. Interestingly, activation of Rab5 on mitochondria depends on the Rab5-GEF ALS2/Alsin, encoded by a gene mutated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Alsin-deficient human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived spinal motor neurons are defective in relocating Rab5 to mitochondria and display increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. These findings define a novel pathway whereby Alsin catalyzes the assembly of the Rab5 endocytic machinery on mitochondria. Defects in stress-sensing by endosomes could be crucial for mitochondrial quality control during the onset of ALS.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}The Author(s) 2016.Many cohort studies have shown that consumption of diets containing a higher composition of foods derived from plants reduces mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD). Here, we examined the active components of a plant-based diet and the underlying mechanisms that reduce the risk of CHD using three rat models and a quantitative proteomics approach. In a short-term myocardial infarction (MI) model, intake of wheat extract (WE), the representative cardioprotectant identified by screening approximately 4,000 samples, reduced myocardial injury by inhibiting apoptosis, enhancing ATP production, and maintaining protein homeostasis. In long-term post-MI models, this myocardial protection resulted in ameliorating adverse left-ventricular remodelling, which is a predictor of heart failure. Among the wheat components, arabinose and xylose were identified as active components responsible for the observed efficacy of WE, which was administered via ingestion and tail-vein injections. Finally, the food components of plant-based diets that contained cell wall polysaccharides rich in arabinose, xylose, and possibly fucose were found to confer protection against myocardial injury. These results show for the first time that specific monosaccharides found in the cell wall polysaccharides in plant-based diets can act as active ingredients that reduce CHD by inhibiting postocclusion steps, including MI and heart failure.},

This review describes recent advances, the challenges as well as applications of metabolic flux analysis comprising fungi, mammalian cells and plants. While MFA is widely established and applied in microorganisms, it remains still a challenge to adapt these methods to eukaryotic cell systems having a higher complexity particularly concerning compartmentation or media composition. In fungi MFA was used in the past few years to analyze a variety of conditions and factors and their effects on cellular metabolism. In mammalian cells MFA was applied mainly in cell culture technology and in medical and toxicological research.13C metabolic studies on native whole plants are additionally challenging by the fact that CO2is usually the only carbon source. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

They exhibited the structural hallmarks of box H/ACA snoRNAs and formed sequence complementarity to 5S rRNA. The nucleotide sequences of the snoRNAs from different donors were highly conserved as evidenced by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and direct nucleotide sequence analysis. Although their host genes had no protein-coding potential, the expression of the snoRNAs was differentially displayed in different tissues. Noticeably, h5sn2 was highly expressed in normal brain, but its expression drastically decreased in meningioma.

abstract = {MicroRNA targets are often recognized through pairing between the miRNA seed region and complementary sites within target mRNAs, but not all of these canonical sites are equally effective, and both computational and in vivo UV-crosslinking approaches suggest that many mRNAs are targeted through non-canonical interactions. Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches. It drives the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks.},

abstract = {Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a human DNA repair-deficient disease that involves transcription coupled repair (TCR), in which three gene products, Cockayne syndrome A (CSA), Cockayne syndrome B (CSB), and ultraviolet stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) cooperate in relieving RNA polymerase II arrest at damaged sites to permit repair of the template strand. Mutation of any of these three genes results in cells with increased sensitivity to UV light and defective TCR. Mutations in CSA or CSB are associated with severe neurological disease but mutations in UVSSA are for the most part only associated with increased photosensitivity. This difference raises questions about the relevance of TCR to neurological disease in CS. We find that CSB-mutated cells, but not UVSSA-deficient cells, have increased levels of intramitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially when mitochondrial complex I is inhibited by rotenone. Increased ROS would result in oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins, lipids, and DNA. CSB appears to behave as an electron scavenger in the mitochondria whose absence leads to increased oxidative stress. Mitochondrial ROS, however, did not cause detectable nuclear DNA damage even when base excision repair was blocked by an inhibitor of polyADP ribose polymerase. Neurodegeneration in Cockayne syndrome may therefore be associated with ROS-induced damage in the mitochondria, independent of nuclear TCR. An implication of our present results is that mitochondrial dysfunction involving ROS has a major impact on CS-B pathology, whereas nuclear TCR may have a minimal role.},

Objectives: To identify and categorize types of Drug Related Problems (DRPs), assess various risk factors for developing DRPs and delineate if drugs with narrow therapeutic index or non-narrow therapeutic index drugs cause greater number of DRPs. Methods: Patients from General Medicine, Surgery, Psychiatry, Cardiac and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) departments of a tertiary care teaching hospital were included. Data was collected prospectively over eight months from medical history, medication charts, case notes and laboratory data. Only those patients prescribed at least five drugs were included. Pediatric and Oncology patients and pregnant women were excluded from the study. Narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drugs (Insulin, digoxin, warfarin, levothyroxine, aminoglycoside antibiotics, carbamazepine, lithium and phenytoin) were compared with non NTI-drugs to delineate patterns of DRPs between both groups. Results: A total of 200 patients were enrolled in the study, and 172 DRPs were identified. The most common DRPs were: drug interactions (63{\%}), inappropriate drug use (10.5{\%}) and adverse drug reactions (10.5{\%}). Polypharmacy and duration of hospitalization were established as significant risk factors for developing DRPs. NTI-drugs had a greater risk of developing DRPs (0.22) versus non-NTI drugs (0.08). Two categories of DRPs were found to be more significantly associated with NTI-drugs: ADRs and inappropriate drug use. Conclusion: While ADR and inappropriate drug use were more common with NTI-drugs, in clinical practice other non NTI-drugs: Anti-psychotic drugs (quetiapine, amisulpride etc.) and NSAIDs (aspirin) showed a high tendency for interactions and needed frequent monitoring.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has very high prevalence and associated-mortality. However, targeted therapies that are currently used in clinical practice for HCC have certain limitations, in part because of the lack of reliable and clinically applicable biomarkers that can be used for diagnosis and prognosis assessments and for the surveillance of treatment effectiveness. METHODS Meta-analysis was used to analyze the integrated microarray data for global identification of a set of robust biomarkers for HCC. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the expression levels of selected genes. Gene expression was inhibited by siRNA. CellTiter 96{\textregistered} AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assays were used to determine cell proliferation, and Transwell assays were used to determine cell migration and invasion potential. RESULTS Meta-analysis of the expression data provided a gene expression signature from a total of 1525 patients with HCC, showing 1529 up-regulated genes and 478 down-regulated genes in cancer samples. The expression levels of genes having strong clinical significance were validated by qRT-PCR using primary HCC tissues and the paired adjacent noncancerous liver tissues. Up-regulation of VPS45, WIPI1, TTC1, IGBP1 and KLHL21 genes and down-regulation of FCGRT gene were confirmed in clinical HCC samples. KLHL21 was the most promising gene for potential use as a bioclinical marker in this analysis. Abrogating expression of it significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that KLHL21 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Our findings also provide novel candidate genes on a genome-wide scale, which may have significant impact on the design and execution of effective therapy of HCC patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The clinical features of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) have not fully been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the clinical features of these patients, particularly with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). METHODS Data on 218 patients with pathologically confirmed diagnoses of NSCLC who had been treated with chemotherapy and/or molecular targeted therapy were retrospectively analyzed for progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), responses to first-line therapy, and incidence of acute exacerbations (AEs). RESULTS Fifty-three of the 218 patients were diagnosed with ILD, and 34 of them with IPF. The frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation was significantly lower in ILD and IPF patients than in non-ILD patients (2 or 0 vs. 32 {\%}, respectively). Median PFS and OS were significantly shorter in both ILD and IPF patients than in non-ILD patients (118, 92, and 196 days for PFS, and 267, 223, and 539 days for OS, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that poor performance status, absence of EGFR mutation, and presence of IPF were poor prognostic factors for PFS and OS. Disease control rate (DCR) was significantly lower in ILD and IPF patients than in non-ILD patients regardless of the presence of EGFR mutation (67 or 53 vs. 85 {\%}, respectively). The incidence of AEs of ILD was significantly higher during chemotherapy with docetaxel-containing regimens (seven of 38; 18.4 {\%}). CONCLUSIONS Both IPF and ILD were associated with lower EGFR positivity, lower DCR, and shorter PFS and OS in advanced NSCLC patients.},

How such a panoply of insults can result in a common phenotype is incompletely understood. Furthermore, very little is known about the transcriptional and epigenetic basis of this disorder, despite evidence that such pathways are likely to play a fundamental role. Here, we compare cell autonomous models of insulin resistance induced by the cytokine tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$ or by the steroid dexamethasone to construct detailed transcriptional and epigenomic maps associated with cellular insulin resistance. These data predict that the glucocorticoid receptor and vitamin D receptor are common mediators of insulin resistance, which we validate using gain- and loss-of-function studies.

To understand how these epigenomic writers orchestrate enhancer landscapes in cell differentiation, we have profiled genomic binding of MLL4, CBP, lineage-determining transcription factors (EBF2, C/EBP$\beta$, C/EBP$\alpha$, PPAR$\gamma$), coactivator MED1, RNA polymerase II, as well as epigenome (H3K4me1/2/3, H3K9me2, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K27ac), transcriptome and chromatin opening during adipogenesis of immortalized preadipocytes derived from mouse brown adipose tissue (BAT). We show that MLL4 and CBP drive the dynamic enhancer epigenome, which correlates with the dynamic transcriptome. MLL3/MLL4 are required for CBP/p300 binding on enhancers activated during adipogenesis. Further, MLL4 and CBP identify super-enhancers (SEs) of adipogenesis and that MLL3/MLL4 are required for SE formation. Finally, in brown adipocytes differentiated in culture, MLL4 identifies primed SEs of genes fully activated in BAT such as Ucp1. Comparison of MLL4-defined SEs in brown and white adipogenesis identifies brown-specific SE-associated genes that could be involved in BAT functions. These results establish MLL3/MLL4 and CBP/p300 as master enhancer epigenomic writers and suggest that enhancer-priming by MLL3/MLL4 followed by enhancer-activation by CBP/p300 sequentially shape dynamic enhancer landscapes during cell differentiation. Our data also provide a rich resource for understanding epigenomic regulation of brown adipogenesis.},

abstract = {Exploiting oxidative stress has recently emerged as a plausible strategy for treatment of human Cancer and anti-oxidant defences are implicated in resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. Targeted suppression of anti-oxidant defences could thus broadly improve therapeutic outcomes. Here we identify the AMPK-related kinase NUAK1 as a key component of the anti-oxidant stress response pathway and reveal a specific requirement for this role of NUAK1 in colorectal cancer. We show that NUAK1 is activated by oxidative stress and that this activation is required to facilitate nuclear import of the anti-oxidant master regulator NRF2: Activation of NUAK1 coordinates PP1$\beta$ inhibition with AKT activation in order to suppress GSK3$\beta$-dependent inhibition of NRF2 nuclear import. Deletion of NUAK1 suppresses formation of colorectal tumors, while acute depletion of NUAK1 induces regression of pre-existing autochthonous tumors. Importantly, elevated expression of NUAK1 in human colorectal cancer is associated with more aggressive disease and reduced overall survival.},

abstract = {Analysis of previously published sets of DNA microarray gene expression data by singular value decomposition has uncovered underlying patterns or "characteristic modes" in their temporal profiles. These patterns contribute unequally to the structure of the expression profiles. Moreover, the essential features of a given set of expression profiles are captured using just a small number of characteristic modes. This leads to the striking conclusion that the transcriptional response of a genome is orchestrated in a few fundamental patterns of gene expression change. These patterns are both simple and robust, dominating the alterations in expression of genes throughout the genome. Moreover, the characteristic modes of gene expression change in response to environmental perturbations are similar in such distant organisms as yeast and human cells. This analysis reveals simple regularities in the seemingly complex transcriptional transitions of diverse cells to new states, and these provide insights into the operation of the underlying genetic networks.},

abstract = {Atheroma formation involves the movement of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) into the subendothelial space. The aim of this study was to determine the involvement of PI3K and MAPK pathways and the importance of cross-talk between these pathways, in glucose-potentiated VSMC chemotaxis to serum factors. VSMC chemotaxis occurred in a serum gradient in 25 mmol/L glucose (but not in 5 mmol/L glucose) in association with increased phosphorylation (activation) of Akt and ERK1/2 in PI3K and MAPK pathways, respectively. Inhibitors of these pathways blocked chemotaxis, as did an mTOR inhibitor. VSMC expressed all class IA PI3K isoforms, but microinjection experiments demonstrated that only the p110beta isoform was involved in chemotaxis. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was reduced not only by MAPK pathway inhibitors but also by PI3K and mTOR inhibitors; when PI3K was inhibited, ERK phosphorylation could be induced by microinjected activated Akt, indicating important cross-talk between the PI3K and ERK1/2 pathways. Glucose-potentiated phosphorylation of molecules in the p38 and JNK MAPK pathways inhibited these pathways but did not affect chemotaxis. The statin, mevinolin, blocked chemotaxis through its effects on the MAPK pathway. Mevinolin-inhibited chemotaxis was restored by farnesylpyrophosphate but not by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate; in the absence of mevinolin, inhibition of farnesyltransferase reduced ERK phosphorylation and blocked chemotaxis, indicating a role for the Ras family of GTPases (MAPK pathway) under these conditions. In conclusion, glucose sensitizes VSMC to serum, inducing chemotaxis via pathways involving p110beta-PI3K, Akt, mTOR, and ERK1/2 MAPK. Cross-talk between the PI3K and MAPK pathways is necessary for VSMC chemotaxis under these conditions.},

abstract = {Regulation of gene expression levels is essential for all living systems and transcription factors (TFs) are the main regulators of gene expression through their ability to repress or induce transcription. A balance between synthesis and degradation rates controls gene expression levels. To determine which rate is dominant, we analyzed the correlation between expression levels of a TF and its regulated gene based on a mathematical model. We selected about 280,000 expression patterns of 355 TFs and 647 regulated genes using DNA microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository. Based on our model, correlation between the expressions of TF-regulated gene pairs corresponds to tuning of the synthesis rate, whereas no correlation indicates excessive synthesis and requires tuning of the degradation rate. The gene expression relationships between TF-regulated gene pairs were classified into four types that correspond to different gene regulatory mechanisms. It was surprising that fewer than 20{\%} of these genes were governed by the familiar regulatory mechanism, i.e., through the synthesis rate. Moreover, we performed pathway analysis and found that each classification type corresponded to distinct gene functions: cellular regulation pathways were dominant in the type with synthesis rate regulation and terms associated with diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease were dominant in the type with degradation rate regulation. Interestingly, these diseases are caused by the accumulation of proteins. These results indicated that gene expression is regulated structurally, not arbitrarily, according to the gene function. This funding is indicative of a systematic control of transcription processes at the whole-cell level.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) are the main players in transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. However, it remains unclear what role TFs played in the origin of all of the different eukaryotic multicellular lineages. In this paper, we explore how the origin of TF repertoires shaped eukaryotic evolution and, in particular, their role into the emergence of multicellular lineages. We traced the origin and expansion of all known TFs through the eukaryotic tree of life, using the broadest possible taxon sampling and an updated phylogenetic background. Our results show that the most complex multicellular lineages (i.e., those with embryonic development, Metazoa and Embryophyta) have the most complex TF repertoires, and that these repertoires were assembled in a stepwise manner.We also show that a significant part of the metazoan and embryophyte TF toolkits evolved earlier, in their respective unicellular ancestors. To gain insights into the role of TFs in the development of both embryophytes and metazoans, we analyzed TF expression patterns throughout their ontogeny. The expression patterns observed in both groups recapitulate those of the whole transcriptome, but reveal some important differences. Our comparative genomics and expression data reshape our view on how TFs contributed to eukaryotic evolution and reveal the importance of TFs to the origins of multicellularity and embryonic development.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Identifying the target genes regulated by transcription factors (TFs) is the most basic step in understanding gene regulation. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology, together with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), enable mapping TF binding sites genome wide, but it is not possible to infer function from binding alone. This is especially true in mammalian systems, where regulation often occurs through long-range enhancers in gene-rich neighborhoods, rather than proximal promoters, preventing straightforward assignment of a binding site to a target gene. RESULTS We present EMBER (Expectation Maximization of Binding and Expression pRofiles), a method that integrates high-throughput binding data (e.g. ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq) with gene expression data (e.g. DNA microarray) via an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for inferring the gene targets of sets of TF binding sites. Genes selected are those that match overrepresented expression patterns, which can be used to provide information about multiple TF regulatory modes. We apply the method to genome-wide human breast cancer data and demonstrate that EMBER confirms a role for the TFs estrogen receptor alpha, retinoic acid receptors alpha and gamma in breast cancer development, whereas the conventional approach of assigning regulatory targets based on proximity does not. Additionally, we compare several predicted target genes from EMBER to interactions inferred previously, examine combinatorial effects of TFs on gene regulation and illustrate the ability of EMBER to discover multiple modes of regulation.

abstract = {Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process hijacked by cancer cells to leave the primary tumor site, invade surrounding tissue, and establish distant metastases. A hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin expression, and one major signal for the induction of EMT is TGF$\beta$, which is dysregulated in up to 40{\%} of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have constructed an EMT network of 70 nodes and 135 edges by integrating the signaling pathways involved in developmental EMT and known dysregulations in invasive HCC. We then used discrete dynamic modeling to understand the dynamics of the EMT network driven by TGF$\beta$. Our network model recapitulates known dysregulations during the induction of EMT and predicts the activation of the Wnt and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathways during this process. We show, across multiple murine (P2E and P2M) and human HCC cell lines (Huh7, PLC/PRF/5, HLE, and HLF), that the TGF$\beta$ signaling axis is a conserved driver of mesenchymal phenotype HCC and confirm that Wnt and SHH signaling are induced in these cell lines. Furthermore, we identify by network analysis eight regulatory feedback motifs that stabilize the EMT process and show that these motifs involve cross-talk among multiple major pathways. Our model will be useful in identifying potential therapeutic targets for the suppression of EMT, invasion, and metastasis in HCC.},

Here, we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) is both necessary and sufficient to mediate insulin resistance in cultured mouse and human adipocytes. Furthermore, adipose-specific Dnmt3a knock-out mice are protected from diet-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance without accompanying changes in adiposity. Unbiased gene profiling studies revealed Fgf21 as a key negatively regulated Dnmt3a target gene in adipocytes with concordant changes in DNA methylation at the Fgf21 promoter region. Consistent with this, Fgf21 can rescue Dnmt3a-mediated insulin resistance, and DNA methylation at the FGF21 locus was elevated in human subjects with diabetes and correlated negatively with expression of FGF21 in human adipose tissue. Taken together, our data demonstrate that adipose Dnmt3a is a novel epigenetic mediator of insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Indeed, microbiome-driven drug metabolism is essential for the activation of certain prodrugs, for example, azo drugs such as prontosil and neoprontosil resulting in the release of sulfanilamide. In addition to providing a major source of reductive metabolizing capability, the gut microbiota provides a suite of additional reactions including acetylation, deacylation, decarboxylation, dehydroxylation, demethylation, dehalogenation, and importantly, in the context of certain types of drug-related toxicity, conjugates hydrolysis reactions. In addition to direct effects, the gut microbiota can affect drug metabolism and toxicity indirectly via, for example, the modulation of host drug metabolism and disposition and competition of bacterial-derived metabolites for xenobiotic metabolism pathways. Also, of course, the therapeutic drugs themselves can have effects, both intended and unwanted, which can impact the health and composition of the gut microbiota with unforeseen consequences.},

However, the underlying epigenetic mechanism has not well been studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sex steroid hormones on epigenetic DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer cells using a signature PCR methylation array panel that correspond to 96 genes with biological function in the human inflammatory and autoimmune signals in prostate cancer. Of the 96-gene panel, 32 genes showed at least 10{\%} differentially methylation level in response to hormonal treatment when compared to untreated cells. Genes that were hypomethylated included CXCL12, CXCL5, CCL25, IL1F8, IL13RAI, STAT5A, CXCR4 and TLR5; and genes that were hypermethylated included ELA2, TOLLIP, LAG3, CD276 and MALT1. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of select genes represented in a cytokine expression array panel showed inverse association between DNA methylation and gene expression for TOLLIP, CXCL5, CCL18 and IL5 genes and treatment of prostate cancer cells with 5′-aza-2′-deoxycytidine with or without trichostatin A induced up-regulation of TOLLIP expression. Further analysis of relative gene expression of matched prostate cancer tissues when compared to benign tissues from individual patients with prostate cancer showed increased and significant expression for CCL18 (2.6-fold; p {\textless} 0.001), a modest yet significant increase in IL5 expression (1.17-fold; p = 0.015), and a modest increase in CXCL5 expression (1.4-fold; p = 0.25).

Exclusion of cell aggregates is then performed based on fluorescence of a nuclear stain followed by positive selection to collect only those cell events containing lipid droplets. Lastly, negative selection of cells expressing stromal or vascular lineage markers removes any remaining stromal contaminants.

@article{Beshir2010,
abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), which negatively regulates multiple signaling cascades including the Raf and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) pathways, functions as a metastasis suppressor. However, the basis for this activity is not clear. We investigated this question in a panel of breast cancer, colon cancer and melanoma cell lines. We found that RKIP negatively regulated the invasion of the different cancer cells through three-dimensional extracellular matrix barriers by controlling the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly, MMP-1 and MMP-2. Silencing of RKIP expression resulted in a highly invasive phenotype and dramatically increased levels of MMP-1 and MMP-2 expression, while overexpression of RKIP decreased cancer cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo of murine tumor allografts. Knockdown of MMP-1 or MMP-2 in RKIP-knockdown cells reverted their invasiveness to normal. In contrast, when examining migration of the different cancer cells in a two-dimensional, barrier-less environment, we found that RKIP had either a positive regulatory activity or no activity, but in no case a negative one (as would be expected if RKIP suppressed metastasis at the level of cell migration itself). Therefore, RKIP's function as a metastasis suppressor appears to arise from its ability to negatively regulate expression of specific MMPs, and thus invasion through barriers, and not from a direct effect on the raw capacity of cells to move. The NF-$\kappa$B pathway, but not the Raf pathway, appeared to positively control the invasion of breast cancer cells. A regulatory loop involving an opposing relationship between RKIP and the NF-$\kappa$B pathway may control the level of MMP expression and cell invasion. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {To understand the evolutionary dynamics between transcription factor (TF) binding and gene expression in mammals, we compared transcriptional output and the binding intensities for three tissue-specific TFs in livers from four closely related mouse species. For each transcription factor, TF-dependent genes and the TF binding sites most likely to influence mRNA expression were identified by comparing mRNA expression levels between wild-type and TF knockout mice. Independent evolution was observed genome-wide between the rate of change in TF binding and the rate of change in mRNA expression across taxa, with the exception of a small number of TF-dependent genes. We also found that binding intensities are preferentially conserved near genes whose expression is dependent on the TF, and the conservation is shared among binding peaks in close proximity to each other near the TSS. Expression of TF-dependent genes typically showed an increased sensitivity to changes in binding levels as measured by mRNA abundance. Taken together, these results highlight a significant tolerance to evolutionary changes in TF binding intensity in mammalian transcriptional networks and suggest that some TF-dependent genes may be largely regulated by a single TF across evolution.},

We showed that phosphorylated (p)-$\Delta$Np63a plays a role in upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, while non-p-$\Delta$Np63a is implicated in pro-survival signaling. In contrast to non-p-$\Delta$Np63a, p-$\Delta$Np63a modulated expression of specific microRNAs in SCC cells exposed to cisplatin.

abstract = {Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process by which cells degrade their own components through the lysosomal machinery. In physiological conditions, the mechanism is tightly regulated and contributes to maintain a balance between synthesis and degradation in cells undergoing intense metabolic activities. Autophagy is associated with major tissue remodeling processes occurring through the embryonic, fetal and early postnatal periods of vertebrates. Here we survey current information implicating autophagy in cellular death, proliferation or differentiation in developing vertebrates. In developing systems, activation of the autophagic machinery could promote different outcomes depending on the cellular context. Autophagy is thus an extraordinary tool for the developing organs and tissues.},

abstract = {The Hippo pathway regulates organ size and tissue homeostasis in response to multiple stimuli, including cell density and mechanotransduction. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatases can also stimulate Hippo signaling in cell culture. We defined the Hippo protein-protein interaction network with and without inhibition of serine and threonine phosphatases by okadaic acid. We identified 749 protein interactions, including 599 previously unrecognized interactions, and demonstrated that several interactions with serine and threonine phosphatases were phosphorylation-dependent. Mutation of the T-loop of MST2 (mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 2), which prevented autophosphorylation, disrupted its association with STRIPAK (striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase complex). Deletion of the amino-terminal forkhead-associated domain of SLMAP (sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein), a component of the STRIPAK complex, prevented its association with MST1 and MST2. Phosphatase inhibition produced temporally distinct changes in proteins that interacted with MOB1A and MOB1B (Mps one binder kinase activator-like 1A and 1B) and promoted interactions with upstream Hippo pathway proteins, such as MST1 and MST2, and with the trimeric protein phosphatase 6 complex (PP6). Mutation of three basic amino acids that are part of a phospho-serine- and phospho-threonine-binding domain in human MOB1B prevented its interaction with MST1 and PP6 in cells treated with okadaic acid. Collectively, our results indicated that changes in phosphorylation orchestrate interactions between kinases and phosphatases in Hippo signaling, providing a putative mechanism for pathway regulation.},

abstract = {Neuroblastomas arise from the neural crest cells and represent the most common solid tumors outside the nervous system in children. The amplification of N-Myc plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of neuroblastomas, whereas acquired mutations of p53 lead to refractory and relapsed cases of neuroblastomas. In this regard, dietary compounds which can target N-Myc and exert anticancer effects independent of p53 status acquire significance in the management of neuroblastomas. Hence, we investigated the anticancer properties of the flavonoid didymin in neuroblastomas. Didymin effectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis irrespective of p53 status in neuroblastomas. Didymin downregulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase, pAkt, Akt, vimentin, and upregulated RKIP levels. Didymin induced G(2)/M arrest along with decreasing the levels of cyclin D1, CDK4, and cyclin B1. Importantly, didymin inhibited N-Myc as confirmed at protein, mRNA, and transcriptional level by promoter-reporter assays. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of didymin-treated (2 mg/kg b.w.) mice serum revealed effective oral absorption with free didymin concentration of 2.1 $\mu$mol/L. Further in vivo mice xenograft studies revealed that didymin-treated (2 mg/kg b.w.) animals had significant reductions in tumors size compared with controls. Didymin strongly inhibited the proliferation (Ki67) and angiogenesis (CD31) markers, as well as N-Myc expression, as revealed by the histopathologic examination of paraffin-embedded section of resected tumors. Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo studies elucidated the anticancer properties and mechanisms of action of a novel, orally active, and palatable flavonoid didymin, which makes it a potential new approach for neuroblastoma therapy (NANT) to target pediatric neuroblastomas.},

abstract = {The class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase VPS34 plays a key role in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and macroautophagy. So far, we know little about the molecular mechanism of VPS34 activation besides its interaction with regulatory proteins to form complexes. Here, we report that VPS34 is specifically acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300, and p300-mediated acetylation represses VPS34 activity. Acetylation at K771 directly diminishes the affinity of VPS34 for its substrate PI, while acetylation at K29 hinders the VPS34-Beclin 1 core complex formation. Inactivation of p300 induces VPS34 deacetylation, PI3P production, and autophagy, even in AMPK−/−, TSC2−/−, or ULK1−/−cells. In fasting mice, liver autophagy correlates well with p300 inactivation/VPS34 deacetylation, which facilitates the clearance of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Thus, p300-dependent VPS34 acetylation/deacetylation is the physiological key to VPS34 activation, which controls the initiation of canonical autophagy and of non-canonical autophagy in which the upstream kinases of VPS34 can be bypassed. Su et al. report a novel mechanism for the activity regulation of lipid kinase VPS34. The acetyltransferase p300-mediated acetylation inhibits VPS34 activity. Deacetylation of VPS34 enhances VPS34-PI interaction and VPS34-Beclin 1 core complex formation. This p300-VPS34 pathway is critical to the initiation of canonical and non-canonical autophagy.},

abstract = {Background: The balance between maintenance of the stem cell state and terminal differentiation is influenced by the cellular environment. The switching between these states has long been understood as a transition between attractor states of a molecular network. Herein, stochastic fluctuations are either suppressed or can trigger the transition, but they do not actually determine the attractor states. Methodology/Principal Findings: We present a novel mathematical concept in which stem cell and progenitor population dynamics are described as a probabilistic process that arises from cell proliferation and small fluctuations in the state of differentiation. These state fluctuations reflect random transitions between different activation patterns of the underlying regulatory network. Importantly, the associated noise amplitudes are state-dependent and set by the environment. Their variability determines the attractor states, and thus actually governs population dynamics. This model quantitatively reproduces the observed dynamics of differentiation and dedifferentiation in promyelocytic precursor cells. Conclusions/Significance: Consequently, state-specific noise modulation by external signals can be instrumental in controlling stem cell and progenitor population dynamics. We propose follow-up experiments for quantifying the imprinting influence of the environment on cellular noise regulation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Hoffmann et al.},

abstract = {Selective autophagy involves the recognition and targeting of specific cargo, such as damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, or invading pathogens for lysosomal destruction. Yeast genetic screens have identified proteins required for different forms of selective autophagy, including cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting, pexophagy and mitophagy, and mammalian genetic screens have identified proteins required for autophagy regulation. However, there have been no systematic approaches to identify molecular determinants of selective autophagy in mammalian cells. Here, to identify mammalian genes required for selective autophagy, we performed a high-content, image-based, genome-wide small interfering RNA screen to detect genes required for the colocalization of Sindbis virus capsid protein with autophagolysosomes. We identified 141 candidate genes required for viral autophagy, which were enriched for cellular pathways related to messenger RNA processing, interferon signalling, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal motor function and metabolism. Ninety-six of these genes were also required for Parkin-mediated mitophagy, indicating that common molecular determinants may be involved in autophagic targeting of viral nucleocapsids and autophagic targeting of damaged mitochondria. Murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking one of these gene products, the C2-domain containing protein, SMURF1, are deficient in the autophagosomal targeting of Sindbis and herpes simplex viruses and in the clearance of damaged mitochondria. Moreover, SMURF1-deficient mice accumulate damaged mitochondria in the heart, brain and liver. Thus, our study identifies candidate determinants of selective autophagy, and defines SMURF1 as a newly recognized mediator of both viral autophagy and mitophagy.},

abstract = {The combined effects of genetic and epigenetic aberrations are well recognized as causal in tumorigenesis. Here, we defined profiles of DNA methylation in primary renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and assessed the association of these profiles with the expression of genes required for the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic marks. A bead-based methylation array platform was used to measure methylation of 1,413 CpG loci in {\~{}}800 cancer-associated genes and three methylation classes were derived by unsupervised clustering of tumors using recursively partitioned mixture modeling (RPMM). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on all tumor samples to determine the expression of DNMT1, DNMT3B, VEZF1 and EZH2. Additionally, methylation at LINE-1 and AluYb8 repetitive elements was measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Associations between methylation class and tumor stage (p = 0.05), LINE-1 (p {\textless} 0.0001) and AluYb8 (p {\textless} 0.0001) methylation, as well as EZH2 expression (p {\textless} 0.0001) were noted following univariate analyses. A multinomial logistic regression model controlling for potential confounders revealed that AluYb8 (p {\textless} 0.003) methylation and EZH2 expression (p {\textless} 0.008) were significantly associated with methylation class membership. Because EZH2 is a member of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), we next analyzed the distribution of Polycomb group (PcG) targets among methylation classes derived by clustering the 1,413 array CpG loci using RPMM. PcG target genes were significantly enriched (p {\textless} 0.0001) in methylation classes with greater differential methylation between RCC and non-diseased kidney tissue. This work contributes to our understanding of how repressive marks on DNA and chromatin are dysregulated in carcinogenesis, knowledge that might aid the development of therapies or preventive strategies for human malignancies.},

To describe encountered adverse effects. Methods. - Short-term (12:weeks), randomized, open-labeled trial. A total of 86 patients (18.6{\%} male, age 41.1 ± 8.7:years, BMI: 36.11 ± 4.34:kg/m2) were randomized to (1) sibutramine group (10:mg/d, n = 22), or (2) orlistat group (3 × 120:mg/d, n = 25), or (3) combination group (10:mg sibutramine/d + 3 × 120:mg orlistat/d, n = 20), or (4) diet group (n = 19). The primary outcome parameter was a decrease in BMI. Additionally patient-reported adverse effects were reported. Results. - The four interventional groups displayed decreases in BMI as follows: (1) -4.41 ± 1.26:kg/m2; (2) -3.64 ± 0.97:kg/m2; (3) -5.12 ± 1.44:kg/m2 and (4) -2.52 ± 1.36:kg/m2; with the diet group showing the significantly lowest decrease in BMI compared to the orlistat (P = 0.004), sibutramine (P {\textless} 0.001) or the combination groups (P {\textless} 0.001), respectively. Decreases in BMI did not statistically differed between the sibutramine group and the combination therapy group (P = 0.072). However, both treatment groups were significantly more efficient in decreasing BMI than the orlistat group (P {\textless} 0.001). In addition to well-known side effects, such as gastrointestinal disturbances, headache and dry mouth, newly described adverse effects were self-reported hypermenorrhea (13.6{\%}, n = 3) with sibutramine and forgetfulness with orlistat (24{\%}, n = 6). Conclusion. - In our study pharmacotherapy showed significant better results in the short-term management of obesity than dietary regimens alone. Sibutramine and sibutramine in combination with orlistat seemed to be equally effective in terms of weight reduction compared to orlistat monotherapy. Attention should be paid to the possibility of adverse effects. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The adipocyte plays a critical role in energy balance. Adipose tissue growth involves an increase in adipocyte size and the formation of new adipocytes from precursor cells. For the last 20 years, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation have been extensively studied using preadipocyte culture systems. Committed preadipocytes undergo growth arrest and subsequent terminal differentiation into adipocytes. This is accompanied by a dramatic increase in expression of adipocyte genes including adipocyte fatty acid binding protein and lipid-metabolizing enzymes. Characterization of regulatory regions of adipose-specific genes has led to the identification of the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), which play a key role in the complex transcriptional cascade during adipocyte differentiation. Growth and differentiation of preadipocytes is controlled by communication between individual cells or between cells and the extracellular environment. Various hormones and growth factors that affect adipocyte differentiation in a positive or negative manner have been identified. In addition, components involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions such as preadipocyte factor-1 and extracellular matrix proteins are also pivotal in regulating the differentiation process. Identification of these molecules has yielded clues to the biochemical pathways that ultimately result in transcriptional activation via PPAR-gamma and C/EBP. Studies on the regulation of the these transcription factors and the mode of action of various agents that influence adipocyte differentiation will reveal the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying adipose tissue development.},

In this study, we investigate the role and mechanism of RKIP in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) radioresistance. The results showed that RKIP was frequently downregulated in the radioresistant NPC tissues compared with radiosensitive NPC tissues, and its reduction correlated with NPC radioresistance and poor patient survival, and was an independent prognostic factor. In vitro radioresponse assay showed that RKIP overexpression decreased while RKIP knockdown increased NPC cell radioresistance. In the NPC xenografts, RKIP overexpression decreased while RKIP knockdown increased tumor radioresistance. Mechanistically, RKIP reduction promoted NPC cell radioresistance by increasing ERK and AKT activity, and AKT may be a downstream transducer of ERK signaling. Moreover, the levels of phospho-ERK-1/2 and phospho-AKT were increased in the radioresistant NPC tissues compared with radiosensitive ones, and negatively associated with RKIP expression, indicating that RKIP-regulated NPC radioresponse is mediated by ERK and AKT signaling in the clinical samples. Our data demonstrate that RKIP is a critical determinant of NPC radioresponse, and its reduction enhances NPC radioresistance through increasing ERK and AKT signaling activity, highlighting the therapeutic potential of RKIP-ERK-AKT signaling axis in NPC radiosensitization.},

abstract = {Purpose To elucidate a noninvasive method to qualify and identify cultured human corneal endothelial cells (cHCECs) devoid of cell-state transition and adaptable for cell-based therapy. Methods The variations of cHCECs in their composition of heterogeneous subpopulations (SPs) were verified in relation to their surface cluster-of-differentiation (CD) markers and their morphology. The profiles of microRNA (miRNA) in cultured cells or supernatants were detected by 3D-Gene Human microRNA Chips (Toray Industries, Inc.). The profiles were also analyzed for fresh corneal tissues with distinct endothelial cell densities (ECD) with or without gutatta. To validate the 3D-Gene results, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed. RNAs were extracted from cHCECs transfected with selected miRNA, and target genes were presumed by PCR array (Qiagen). Results Among a variety of morphologically different cHCECs, miRNA expression profiles were distinctively revealed. The one miRNA capable of discriminating CD44- SP from SPs with CD44++∼CD44+++ phenotypes was identified as miR34a. The downregulation of miRNAs in the 378 family paralleled the upregulation of surface CD44 on cHCECs. Interestingly, upregulated miRNAs in the 378 family in corneal endothelium dramatically decreased in the tissues with lower ECD with advanced gutatta, providing new insight on the pathogenesis of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy. Conclusions The specified cultured SPs sharing the CD44- surface phenotypes with matured HCECs showed the highest expression of miR-378.

abstract = {The data revolution has led to an increased interest in the practice of data analysis. As a result, there has been a proliferation of "data science" training programs. Because data science has been previously defined as an intersection of already-established fields or union of emerging technologies, the following problems arise: (1) There is little agreement about what is data science; (2) Data science becomes secondary to established fields in a university setting; and (3) It is difficult to have discussions on what it means to learn about data science, to teach data science courses and to be a data scientist. To address these problems, we propose to define the field from first principles based on the activities of people who analyze data with a language and taxonomy for describing a data analysis in a manner spanning disciplines. Here, we describe the elements and principles of data analysis. This leads to two insights: it suggests a formal mechanism to evaluate data analyses based on objective characteristics, and it provides a framework to teach students how to build data analyses. We argue that the elements and principles of data analysis lay the foundational framework for a more general theory of data science.},

abstract = {Background: Growing evidence suggests that Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway plays an important role in CRC development, progression and metastasis. Aberrant miR-224 expression has been reported in CRC. However, the mechanism of miR-224 promotes both proliferation and metastatic ability largely remains unclear. Methods: Real-time PCR was used to quantify miR-224 expression. Luciferase reporter assays were conducted to confirm the activity of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway and target gene associations, and immunofluorescence staining assay was performed to observe the nuclear translocation of $\beta$-catenin. Bioinformatics analysis combined with in vivo and vitro functional assays showed the potential target genes, GSK3$\beta$ and SFRP2, of miR-224. Specimens from forty patients with CRC were analyzed for the expression of miR-224 and the relationship with GSK3$\beta$/SFRP2 by real-time PCR and western blot. Results: Bioinformatics and cell luciferase function studies verified the direct regulation of miR-224 on the 3'-UTR of the GSK3$\beta$ and SFRP2 genes, which leads to the activation of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling and the nuclear translocation of $\beta$-catenin. In addition, knockdown of miR-224 significantly recovered the expression of GSK3$\beta$ and SFRP2 and attenuated Wnt/$\beta$-catenin-mediated cell metastasis and proliferation. The ectopic upregulation of miR-224 dramatically inhibited the expression of GSK3$\beta$/SFRP2 and enhanced CRC proliferation and invasion. Conclusion: Our research showed mechanistic links between miR-224 and Wnt/$\beta$-catenin in the pathogenesis of CRC through modulation of GSK3$\beta$ and SFRP2.},

abstract = {Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers in the world and a significant threat to the health of patients, especially those from China and Japan. The prognosis for patients with late stage GC receiving the standard of care treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, remains poor. Developing novel treatment strategies, identifying new molecules for targeted therapy, and devising screening techniques to detect this cancer in its early stages are needed for GC patients. The discovery of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), primarily microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), helped to elucidate the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, diagnosis and treatment of GC. Recently, significant research has been conducted on non-coding RNAs and how the regulatory dysfunction of these RNAs impacts the tumorigenesis of GC. In this study, we review papers published in the last five years concerning the dysregulation of non-coding RNAs, especially miRNAs and lncRNAs, in GC. We summarize instances of aberrant expression of the ncRNAs in GC and their effect on survival-related events, including cell cycle regulation, AKT signaling, apoptosis and drug resistance. Additionally, we evaluate how ncRNA dysregulation affects the metastatic process, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stem cells, transcription factor activity, and oncogene and tumor suppressor expression. Lastly, we determine how ncRNAs affect angiogenesis in the microenvironment of GC. We further discuss the use of ncRNAs as potential biomarkers for use in clinical screening, early diagnosis and prognosis of GC. At present, no ideal ncRNAs have been identified as targets for the treatment of GC.},

abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by its sudden manifestation, rapid progression, poor prognosis, and limited therapeutic options. Genetic alterations in key signaling pathways found in early pancreatic lesions are pivotal for the development and progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplastic lesions into invasive carcinomas. More than 90{\%} of PDAC tumors harbor driver mutations in K-Ras that activate various downstream effector-signaling pathways, including the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The PI3K pathway also responds to stimuli from various growth factor receptors present on the cancer cell surface that, in turn, modulate downstream signaling cascades. Thus, the inositide signaling acts as a central node in the complex cellular signaling networks to impact cancer cell growth, motility, metabolism, and survival. Also, recent publications highlight the importance of PI3K signaling in stromal cells, whereby PI3K signaling modifies the tumor microenvironment to dictate disease outcome. The high incidence of mutations in the PI3K signaling cascade, accompanied by activation of parallel signaling pathways, makes PI3K a promising candidate for drug therapy. In this review, we describe the role of PI3K signaling in pancreatic cancer development and progression. We also discuss the crosstalk between PI3K and other major cellular signaling cascades, and potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.},

abstract = {Purpose: External beam radiotherapy (RT) is often used in an attempt to cure localized prostate cancer (PCa), but it is only palliative against disseminated disease. Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is a metastasis suppressor whose expression is reduced in approximately 50{\%} of localized PCa tissues and is absent in metastases. Chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to induce tumor apoptosis through induction of RKIP expression. Our goal was to test whether RT similarly induces apoptosis through induction of RKIP expression. Methods and Materials: The C4-2B PCa cell line was engineered to overexpress or underexpress RKIP. The engineered cells were tested for apoptosis in cell culture and tumor regression in mice after RT. Results: RT induced both RKIP expression and apoptosis of PCa cells. Overexpression of RKIP sensitized PCa cells to radiation-induced apoptosis. In contrast, short-hairpin targeting of RKIP, so that RT could not induce RKIP expression, protected cells from radiation-induced apoptosis. In a murine model, knockdown of RKIP in PCa cells diminished radiation-induced apoptosis. Molecular concept mapping of genes altered on manipulation of RKIP expression revealed an inverse correlation with the concept of genes altered by RT. Conclusion: The data presented in this report indicate that the loss of RKIP, as seen in primary PCa tumors and metastases, confers protection against radiation-induced apoptosis. Therefore, it is conceivable that the loss of RKIP confers a growth advantage on PCa cells at distant sites, because the loss of RKIP would decrease apoptosis, favoring proliferation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {RATIONALE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating lung disease of unknown etiology. TOLLIP and MUC5B play important roles in lung host defense, an immune process influenced by oxidative signaling. Whether polymorphisms in TOLLIP and MUC5B modify the effect of immunosuppressive and antioxidant therapy in patients with IPF is unknown. OBJECTIVE To determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TOLLIP and MUC5B modify the effect of trial interventions in patients participating in the PANTHER-IPF clinical trial. METHODS SNPs within TOLLIP (rs5743890/rs5743894/rs5743854/rs3750920) and MUC5B (rs35705950) were genotyped. Interaction modeling was conducted with multivariable Cox regression followed by genotype-stratified survival analysis using a composite endpoint of death, transplant, hospitalization or ≥10{\%} FVC decline. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Significant interaction was observed between NAC therapy and rs3750920 within TOLLIP (pinteraction = 0.001). After stratifying by rs3750920 genotype, NAC therapy was associated with a significant reduction in composite endpoint risk (HR 0.14; 95{\%} CI 0.02-0.83; p=0.03) in those with a TT genotype, but a non-significant increase in composite endpoint risk (HR 3.23; 95{\%} CI 0.79-13.16; p=0.10) in those with a CC genotype. These findings were then replicated in an independent IPF cohort. CONCLUSIONS NAC may be an efficacious therapy for IPF patients with an rs3750920 (TOLLIP) TT genotype, but was was associated with a trend towards harm in those with a CC genotype. A genotype-stratified prospective clinical trial should be conducted prior to any recommendation regarding the use of off-label NAC to treat IPF.},

Here, we use promoter capture Hi-C to demonstrate a rapid reorganization of promoter-anchored chromatin loops within 4 hr after inducing differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The establishment of new promoter-enhancer loops is tightly coupled to activation of poised (histone H3 lysine 4 mono- and dimethylated) enhancers, as evidenced by the acquisition of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation and the binding of MED1, SMC1, and P300 proteins to these regions, as well as to activation of target genes. Intriguingly, formation of loops connecting activated enhancers and promoters is also associated with extensive recruitment of corepressors such as NCoR and HDACs, indicating that this class of coregulators may play a previously unrecognized role during enhancer activation.},

Mutation of Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) affects neuronal gene expression and differentiation, so we attempted to bypass its function by expressing downstream target genes. Intriguingly, ectopic expression of Synaptotagmin 9 (SYT9), a key component of the machinery controlling neurotrophin release, bypasses the need for CSB in neuritogenesis. Importantly, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin implicated in neuronal differentiation and synaptic modulation, and pharmacological mimics such as 7,8-dihydroxyflavone and amitriptyline can compensate for CSB deficiency in cell models of neuronal differentiation as well. SYT9 and BDNF are downregulated in CS patient brain tissue, further indicating that sub-optimal neurotrophin signaling underlies neurological defects in CS. In addition to shedding light on cellular mechanisms underlying CS and pointing to future avenues for pharmacological intervention, these data suggest an important role for SYT9 in neuronal differentiation.},

abstract = {The differentiation of most mammalian cells is preceded by growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but the characteristics of this state have not been established. We now report that the growth arrest that precedes the differentiation of BALB/c 3T3 T mouse proadipocytes must occur at a distinct state in G1 designated GD. GD-arrested cells are characterized by their ability to differentiate in the absence of DNA synthesis and by their unique sensitivity to the mitogenic effect of isobutylmethylxanthine. Proadipocytes induced to become G1 growth arrested at other states by culture in medium deficient in growth factor or nutrients, by contrast, are unable to differentiate in the absence of DNA synthesis and are not stimulated to proliferate by isobutylmethylxanthine even when they are exposed to differentiation-promoting medium prior to arrest. These data support the conclusion that, prior to the expression of a differentiated phenotype, proadipocytes must arrest their growth at a distinct state in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, GD. These data also provide the basis for the hypothesis that carcinogenesis is associated with defects in the coupling of growth arrest and differentiation at the GD state.},

abstract = {Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is fundamental to both embryogenesis and tumor metastasis. The Notch intercellular signaling pathway regulates cell fate determination throughout metazoan evolution, and overexpression of activating alleles is oncogenic in mammals. Here we demonstrate that Notch activity promotes EMT during both cardiac development and oncogenic transformation via transcriptional induction of the Snail repressor, a potent and evolutionarily conserved mediator of EMT in many tissues and tumor types. In the embryonic heart, Notch functions via lateral induction to promote a selective transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)-mediated EMT that leads to cellularization of developing cardiac valvular primordia. Embryos that lack Notch signaling elements exhibit severely attenuated cardiac snail expression, abnormal maintenance of intercellular endocardial adhesion complexes, and abortive endocardial EMT in vivo and in vitro. Accordingly, transient ectopic expression of activated Notch1 (N1IC) in zebrafish embryos leads to hypercellular cardiac valves, whereas Notch inhibition prevents valve development. Overexpression of N1IC in immortalized endothelial cells in vitro induces EMT accompanied by oncogenic transformation, with corresponding induction of snail and repression of VE-cadherin expression. Notch is expressed in embryonic regions where EMT occurs, suggesting an intimate and fundamental role for Notch, which may be reactivated during tumor metastasis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Metastasis is the main cause of cancer patient deaths and remains a poorly characterized process. It is still unclear when in tumor progression the ability to metastasize arises and whether this ability is inherent to the primary tumor or is acquired well after primary tumor formation. Next-generation sequencing and analytical methods to define clonal heterogeneity provide a means for identifying genetic events and the temporal relationships between these events in the primary and metastatic tumors within an individual. METHODS AND FINDINGS We performed DNA whole genome and mRNA sequencing on two primary tumors, each with either four or five distinct tissue site-specific metastases, from two individuals with triple-negative/basal-like breast cancers. As evidenced by their case histories, each patient had an aggressive disease course with abbreviated survival. In each patient, the overall gene expression signatures, DNA copy number patterns, and somatic mutation patterns were highly similar across each primary tumor and its associated metastases. Almost every mutation found in the primary was found in a metastasis (for the two patients, 52/54 and 75/75). Many of these mutations were found in every tumor (11/54 and 65/75, respectively). In addition, each metastasis had fewer metastatic-specific events and shared at least 50{\%} of its somatic mutation repertoire with the primary tumor, and all samples from each patient grouped together by gene expression clustering analysis. TP53 was the only mutated gene in common between both patients and was present in every tumor in this study. Strikingly, each metastasis resulted from multiclonal seeding instead of from a single cell of origin, and few of the new mutations, present only in the metastases, were expressed in mRNAs. Because of the clinical differences between these two patients and the small sample size of our study, the generalizability of these findings will need to be further examined in larger cohorts of patients. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that multiclonal seeding may be common amongst basal-like breast cancers. In these two patients, mutations and DNA copy number changes in the primary tumors appear to have had a biologic impact on metastatic potential, whereas mutations arising in the metastases were much more likely to be passengers.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Mitochondria play a key role in energy metabolism in many tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle, brain, liver, and adipose tissue. Three types of adipose depots can be identified in mammals, commonly classified according to their colour appearance: the white (WAT), the brown (BAT), and the beige/brite/brown-like (bAT) adipose tissues. WAT is mainly involved in the storage and mobilization of energy and BAT is predominantly responsible for nonshivering thermogenesis. Recent data suggest that adipocyte mitochondria might play an important role in the development of obesity through defects in mitochondrial lipogenesis and lipolysis, regulation of adipocyte differentiation, apoptosis, production of oxygen radicals, efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and regulation of conversion of white adipocytes into brown-like adipocytes. This review summarizes the main characteristics of each adipose tissue subtype and describes morphological and functional modifications focusing on mitochondria and their activity in healthy and unhealthy adipocytes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Using a combination of advanced proteomics and genomics approaches, we identify {\~{}}12,000 transcription factor hotspots ({\~{}}400bp) in the early phase of adipogenesis, and we find evidence of both simultaneous and sequential binding of transcription factors at these regions. We demonstrate that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancer regions (several kilobases), which drive the early adipogenic reprogramming of gene expression. Our results indicate that cooperativity between transcription factors at the level of hotspots as well as super-enhancers is very important for enhancer activity and transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, hotspots and super-enhancersconstitute important regulatory hubs that serve to integrate external stimuli on chromatin. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

We further investigated the role of miR-378 in the proliferation and apoptosis of SKM-1 cells, an acute myeloid leukemia cell line established in the leukemic phase during the progression of MDS to AML (MDS/AML). Results indicated that overexpression of miR-378 in SKM-1 cells interfered with proliferation via inducing apoptosis and G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest, and suppressive effect of miR-378 on MDS/AML cells may be mediated partly through Bcl-w and CDC40. Moreover, apoptosis induced by miR-378 correlated with increased expression of Bax and activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Taken together, our data support a critical role for miR-378 in the pathogenesis of MDS and provide a novel therapeutic target in this complex disease.},

abstract = {Gene expression in organisms is controlled by regulatory proteins termed transcription factors, which recognize and bind to specific nucleotide sequences. Over the years, considerable information has accumulated on the regulatory interactions between transcription factors and their target genes in various model prokaryotes, such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. This has allowed the representation of this information in the form of a directed graph, which is commonly referred to as the transcriptional regulatory network. The network representation provides us with an excellent conceptual framework to understand the structure of the transcriptional regulation, both at local and global levels of organization. Several studies suggest that the transcriptional network inferred from model organisms may be approximated by a scale-free topology, which in turn implies the presence of a relatively small group of highly connected regulators (hubs or global regulators). While the graph theoretical principles have been applied to infer various properties of such networks, there have been few studies that have actually investigated the evolution of the transcriptional regulatory networks across diverse organisms. Using recently developed computational methods that exploit various evolutionary principles, we have attempted to reconstruct and compare these networks across a wide-range of prokaryotes. This has provided several insights on the modification and diversification of network structures of various organisms in course of evolution. Firstly, we observed that target genes show a much higher level of conservation than their transcriptional regulators. This in turn suggested that the same set of functions could be differently controlled across diverse organisms, contributing significantly to their adaptive radiations. In particular, at the local level of network structure, organism-specific optimization of the transcription network has evolved primarily via tinkering of individual regulatory interactions rather than whole scale reuse or deletion of network motifs (local structure). In turn, as phylogenetic diversification proceeds, this process appears to have favored repeated convergence to scale-free-like structures, albeit with different regulatory hubs.},

abstract = {The process of entering the bloodstream, intravasation, is a necessary step in the development of distant metastases. The focus of this review is on the pathways and molecules that have been identified as being important based on current in vitro and in vivo assays for intravasation. Properties of the vasculature which are important for intravasation include microvessel density and also diameter of the vasculature, with increased intravasation correlating with increased vessel diameter in some tumors. TGFB signaling can enhance intravasation at least in part through induction of EMT, and we discuss other TGFB target genes that are important for intravasation. In addition to TGFB signaling, a number of studies have demonstrated that activation of EGF receptor family members stimulates intravasation, with downstream signaling through PI3K, NWASP, RhoA and WASP to induce invadopodia. With respect to proteases, there is strong evidence for contributions by uPA/uPAR, while the roles of MMPs in intravasation may be more tumor specific. Other cells including macrophages, fibroblasts, neutrophils, and platelets can also play a role in enhancing tumor cell intravasation. The technology is now available to interrogate the expression patterns of circulating tumor cells, which will provide an important reality check for the model systems being used. With a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying intravasation, the goal is to provide new opportunities for improving prognosis as well as potentially developing new treatments.},

Several PCBP family members have been reported to be involved in human malignancies. Here, we show that PCBP2 is upregulated in human glioma tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of PCBP2 inhibited glioma growth in vitro and in vivo through inhibition of cell-cycle progression and induction of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. Thirty-five mRNAs were identified as putative PCBP2 targets/interactors using RIP-ChIP protein-RNA interaction arrays in a human glioma cell line, T98G. Four-and-a-half LIM domain 3 (FHL3) mRNA was downregulated in human gliomas and was identified as a PCBP2 target. Knockdown of PCBP2 enhanced the expression of FHL3 by stabilizing its mRNA. Overexpression of FHL3 attenuated cell growth and induced apoptosis. This study establishes a link between PCBP2 and FHL3 proteins and identifies a new pathway for regulating glioma progression.},

abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. Brain metastasis (BM) can affect about 25{\%} of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients during their lifetime. Efforts to characterize patients that will develop BM have been disappointing. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in regulating a variety of targets and, consequently, multiple pathways, which make them a powerful tool for early detection of disease, risk assessment and prognosis. In this study, using RT-PCR and further northern blot validation, we confirmed that miR-378 was significantly differentially expressed in the matched NSCLC from 8 patients with BM and 21 without BM. Our study showed evidences that miR-378 is associated with non-small cell lung cancer brain metastasis by promoting cell migration, invasion and tumor angiogenesis. MiR-378 may be a potential biomarker for characterizing non-small cell lung cancer brain metastasis and assisting clinicians in stratifying the high-risk patients on a clinical trial for either prophylactic cranial irradiation or a new intervention that may mitigate BM development, ultimately leading to a new standard of care for NSCLC patients.},

The decentralized nature of our scientific community and healthcare system, however, has resulted in a patchwork of diverse, or heterogeneous, database implementations, making access to and aggregation of data across databases very difficult. The database heterogeneity problem applies equally to clinical data describing individual patients and biological data characterizing our genome. Specifically, databases are highly heterogeneous with respect to the data models they employ, the data schemas they specify, the query languages they support, and the terminologies they recognize. Heterogeneous database systems attempt to unify disparate databases by providing uniform conceptual schemas that resolve representational heterogeneities, and by providing querying capabilities that aggregate and integrate distributed data. Research in this area has applied a variety of database and knowledge-based techniques, including semantic data modeling, ontology definition, query translation, query optimization, and terminology mapping. Existing systems have addressed heterogeneous database integration in the realms of molecular biology, hospital information systems, and application portability. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science (USA).},

However, its potential significance of nucleoplasmic localizations remains greatly elusive. Here we demonstrate that PML interacts with LC3 in a cell type-independent manner as assessed by Co-IP assay and co-localization observation. Overexpressed PML significantly coprecipitates with endogenous and nuclear LC3 protein. Furthermore, a fraction of endogenous PML protein is found to be co-localized with LC3 protein under steady state condition, which is further enhanced by IFNalpha induction, indicating that PML up-regulation potentiates this interaction. Additionally, DsRed-PML associates with EGFP-LC3 during telophase and G1 phase but not in metaphase and anaphase. Two potential LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs in PML are required for interaction of PML with LC3 while this association is independent of autophagic activity. Finally, we show that interaction between PML and LC3 contributes to cell growth inhibition function of PML. Considering that PML is an important tumor suppressor, we propose that nuclear portion of LC3 protein may associate with PML to control cell growth for prevention and inhibition of cancer occurrence and development.},

Genome-wide analyses of chromatin accessibility and binding of adipogenic transcription factors make it possible to generate "snapshots" of the transcription factor networks operating at specific time points during adipogenesis. Using such global "snapshots," we have demonstrated that dramatic remodeling of the chromatin template occurs within the first few hours following adipogenic stimulation and that many of the early transcription factors bind in a cooperative fashion to transcription factor hotspots. Such hotspots are likely to represent key chromatin nodes, where many adipogenic signaling pathways converge to drive the adipogenic transcriptional reprogramming.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is increasing rapidly. In this population, behavioral therapy alone has had limited success in providing meaningful, sustained weight reduction, and pharmacological treatment has not been extensively studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of orlistat in weight management of adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Multicenter, 54-week (August 2000-October 2002), randomized, double-blind study of 539 obese adolescents (aged 12-16 years; body mass index [BMI] {\textgreater}or=2 units above the 95th percentile) at 32 centers in the United States and Canada. INTERVENTIONS: A 120-mg dose of orlistat (n = 357) or placebo (n = 182) 3 times daily for 1 year, plus a mildly hypocaloric diet (30{\%} fat calories), exercise, and behavioral therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in BMI; secondary measures included changes in waist and hip circumference, weight loss, lipid measurements, and glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose challenge. RESULTS: There was a decrease in BMI in both treatment groups up to week 12, thereafter stabilizing with orlistat but increasing beyond baseline with placebo. At the end of the study, BMI had decreased by 0.55 with orlistat but increased by 0.31 with placebo (P = .001). Compared with 15.7{\%} of the placebo group, 26.5{\%} of participants taking orlistat had a 5{\%} or higher decrease in BMI (P = .005); 4.5{\%} and 13.3{\%}, respectively, had a 10{\%} or higher decrease in BMI (P = .002). At study end, weight had increased 0.53 kg with orlistat and 3.14 kg with placebo (P{\textless}.001). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry showed that this difference was explained by changes in fat mass. Waist circumference decreased in the orlistat group but increased in the placebo group (-1.33 cm vs +0.12 cm; P{\textless}.05). Generally mild to moderate gastrointestinal tract adverse events occurred in 9{\%} to 50{\%} of the orlistat group and in 1{\%} to 13{\%} of the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In combination with diet, exercise, and behavioral modification, orlistat statistically significantly improved weight management in obese adolescents compared with placebo. The use of orlistat for 1 year in this adolescent population did not raise major safety issues although gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the orlistat group.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1) promotes tumor metastasis by inducing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of BIX02189 and XMD8-92, pharmacologic inhibitors of the MEK5 [mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)5] signaling pathway, on the EMT and migration of cancer cells induced by TGF-$\beta$1. In human A549 lung cancer cells, TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT, cell motility, and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 were completely inhibited by BIX02189, but not by XMD8-92 or small interference RNAs specific to MEK5 and ERK5. Interestingly, BIX02189 strongly blocked the activation of TGF-$\beta$1 signaling components, and this inhibitory effect was not reproduced by MEK5 inhibition. Molecular docking simulation and kinase assays revealed that BIX02189 binds directly to the ATP-binding site of the TGF-$\beta$ receptor type I (T$\beta$RI) and suppresses its kinase activity. Finally, the anti-metastatic effect of BIX02189 was validated in a T$\beta$RI-derived A549 xenograft mouse model. Collectively, these findings newly characterize BIX02189 as a potent inhibitor of T$\beta$RI that can block the tumor metastatic activity of TGF-$\beta$1.},

abstract = {Summary The organization of a cell emerges from the interactions in protein networks. The interactome is critically dependent on the strengths of interactions and the cellular abundances of the connected proteins, both of which span orders of magnitude. However, these aspects have not yet been analyzed globally. Here, we have generated a library of HeLa cell lines expressing 1,125 GFP-tagged proteins under near-endogenous control, which we used as input for a next-generation interaction survey. Using quantitative proteomics, we detect specific interactions, estimate interaction stoichiometries, and measure cellular abundances of interacting proteins. These three quantitative dimensions reveal that the protein network is dominated by weak, substoichiometric interactions that play a pivotal role in defining network topology. The minority of stable complexes can be identified by their unique stoichiometry signature. This study provides a rich interaction dataset connecting thousands of proteins and introduces a framework for quantitative network analysis.},

abstract = {Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumour in children and adolescents. Accumulating evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in the development of almost all types of cancer. Here, we investigated the role of miR-224 in the development and progression of osteosarcoma. We demonstrated that miR-224 was down-regulated in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues. Lower miR-224 levels were correlated with shorter survivalin osteosarcoma patients. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-224 suppressed osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion and contributed to the increased sensitivity of MG-63 cells to cisplatin. We identified Rac1 as a direct target gene of miR-224 in osteosarcoma. Rac1 expression was up-regulated in the osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues, and there was an inverse correlation between Rac1 and miR-224 expression in osteosarcoma tissues. Furthermore, rescuing Rac1 expression decreased the sensitivity of miR-224-overexpressing MG-63 cells to cisplatin. We also demonstrated that ectopic expression of Rac1 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of miR-224-overexpressing MG-63 cells. These data suggest that miR-224 plays a tumour suppressor role in the development of osteosarcoma and is related to the sensitivity of osteosarcoma to cisplatin.},

abstract = {Functional cell-to-cell variability is ubiquitous in multicellular organisms as well as bacterial populations. Even genetically identical cells of the same cell type can respond differently to identical stimuli. Methods have been developed to analyse heterogeneous populations, e.g., mixture models and stochastic population models. The available methods are, however, either incapable of simultaneously analysing different experimental conditions or are computationally demanding and difficult to apply. Furthermore, they do not account for biological information available in the literature. To overcome disadvantages of existing methods, we combine mixture models and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. The ODE models provide a mechanistic description of the underlying processes while mixture models provide an easy way to capture variability. In a simulation study, we show that the class of ODE constrained mixture models can unravel the subpopulation structure and determine the sources of cell-to-cell variability. In addition, the method provides reliable estimates for kinetic rates and subpopulation characteristics. We use ODE constrained mixture modelling to study NGF-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation in primary sensory neurones, a process relevant in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We propose a mechanistic pathway model for this process and reconstructed static and dynamical subpopulation characteristics across experimental conditions. We validate the model predictions experimentally, which verifies the capabilities of ODE constrained mixture models. These results illustrate that ODE constrained mixture models can reveal novel mechanistic insights and possess a high sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Hasenauer et al.},

abstract = {Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise. {\textcopyright} 2006 Raj et al.},

abstract = {Although the newly developed second-generation anti-androgen drug enzalutamide can repress prostate cancer progression significantly, it only extends the survival of prostate cancer patients by 4-6 months mainly due to the occurrence of enzalutamide resistance. Most of the previous studies on AR antagonist resistance have been focused on AR signaling. Therefore, the non-AR pathways on enzalutamide resistance remain largely unknown. By using C4-2, CWR22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines, as well as mice bearing CWR22Rv1 xenografts treated with either enzalutamide or metformin alone or in combination, we demonstrated that metformin is capable of reversing enzalutamide resistance and restores sensitivity of CWR22Rv1 xenografts to enzalutamide. We showed that metformin alleviated resistance to enzalutamide by inhibiting EMT. Furthermore, based on the effect of metformin on the activation of STAT3 and expression of TGF-$\beta$1, we propose that metformin exerts its effects by targeting the TGF-$\beta$1/STAT3 axis. These findings suggest that combination of metformin with enzalutamide could be a more efficacious therapeutic strategy for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.},

Since ECGC is not a clinically approved drug, we attempted to identify other compounds that might favourably interact with cysteamine to induce autophagy and thus rescuing the function of $\Delta$F508 CFTR as a chloride channel in the plasma membrane. For this, we screened a compound library composed by chemically diverse autophagy inducers for their ability to enhance autophagic flux in the presence of cysteamine. We identified the antiarrhythmic Ca 2+ channel blocker amiodarone, as an FDA-approved drug having the property to cooperate with cysteamine to stimulate autophagy in an additive manner. Amiodarone promoted the re-expression of $\Delta$F508 CFTR protein in the plasma membrane of respiratory epithelial cells. Hence, amiodarone might be yet another compound for the etiological therapy of CF in patients bearing the $\Delta$F508 CFTR mutation.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies in US adults. Experimental studies have found that antioxidant nutrients could reduce oxidative DNA damage, suggesting that these antioxidants may protect against pancreatic carcinogenesis. Several epidemiologic studies showed that dietary intake of antioxidants was inversely associated with the risk for pancreatic cancer, demonstrating the inhibitory effects of antioxidants on pancreatic carcinogenesis. Moreover, nutraceuticals, the anticancer agents from diet or natural plants, have been found to inhibit the development and progression of pancreatic cancer through the regulation of cellular signaling pathways. Importantly, nutraceuticals also up-regulate the expression of tumor-suppressive microRNAs (miRNAs) and down-regulate the expression of oncogenic miRNAs, leading to the inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell growth and pancreatic cancer stem cell self-renewal through modulation of cellular signaling network. Furthermore, nutraceuticals also regulate epigenetically deregulated DNAs and miRNAs, leading to the normalization of altered cellular signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, nutraceuticals could have much broader use in the prevention and/or treatment of pancreatic cancer in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics. However, more in vitro mechanistic experiments, in vivo animal studies, and clinical trials are needed to realize the true value of nutraceuticals in the prevention and/or treatment of pancreatic cancer.},

This conservation implies that the coexpression of these gene pairs confers a selective advantage and therefore that these genes are functionally related. Many of these relationships provide strong evidence for the involvement of new genes in core biological functions such as the cell cycle, secretion, and protein expression. We experimentally confirmed the predictions implied by some of these links and identified cell proliferation functions for several genes.

Mitochondrial damage induces a physical association of AMPK with ATG16-ATG5-12 and an AMPK-dependent recruitment of the VPS34 and ATG16 complexes with the mitochondria. Targeting AMPK to the mitochondria is both sufficient to induce mitophagy and to promote cell survival. Recruitment of AMPK to the mitochondria requires N-myristoylation of AMPK$\beta$ by the type-I N-myristoyltransferase 1 (NMT1). Our data support a spatiotemporal model wherein recruitment of AMPK in association with components of the VPS34 and ATG16 complex to damaged mitochondria regulates selective mitophagy to maintain cancer cell viability.},

abstract = {The age-associated deterioration in cellular and organismal functions associates with dysregulation of nutrient-sensing pathways and disabled autophagy. The reactivation of autophagic flux may prevent or ameliorate age-related metabolic dysfunctions. Non-toxic compounds endowed with the capacity to reduce the overall levels of protein acetylation and to induce autophagy have been categorized as caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs). Here, we show that aspirin or its active metabolite salicylate induce autophagy by virtue of their capacity to inhibit the acetyltransferase activity of EP300. While salicylate readily stimulates autophagic flux in control cells, it fails to further increase autophagy levels in EP300-deficient cells, as well as in cells in which endogenous EP300 has been replaced by salicylate-resistant EP300 mutants. Accordingly, the pro-autophagic activity of aspirin and salicylate on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is lost when the expression of the EP300 ortholog cpb-1 is reduced. Altogether, these findings identify aspirin as an evolutionary conserved CRM. Pietrocola et al. show that the inhibition of the acetyltransferase EP300 is determinant for the autophagy-inducing effect of aspirin and its active metabolite salicylate. As a proof of the evolutionarily conserved nature of this mechanism, the authors demonstrate that aspirin triggers protective autophagy in mice and in the nematode C. elegans.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Background: Epithelial ovarian cancer is the second most lethal gynecological cancer worldwide. Ascites can be found in all clinical stages, however in advanced disease stages IIIC and IV it is more frequent and could be massive, associated with worse prognosis. Due to the above, it was our interest to understanding how the ascites of ovarian cancer patients induces the mechanisms by which the cells present in it acquire a more aggressive phenotype and to know new proteins associated to this process. Methods: A proteomic analysis of SKOV-3 cells treated with five different EOC ascites was performed by two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled to MALDI-TOF. The level of expression of the proteins of interest was validated by RT-PCR because several of these proteins have only been reported at the messenger level. Results: Among the proteins identified that increased their expression in ascites-treated SKOV-3 cells, were Ran GTPase, ZNF268, and Synaptotagmin like-3. On the other hand, proteins that were negatively regulated by ascites were HLA-I, HSPB1, ARF1, Synaptotagmin 1, and hnRNPH1, among others. Furthermore, an interactome for every one of these proteins was done in order to identify biological processes, molecular actions, and cellular components in which they may participate. Conclusions: Identified proteins participate in cellular processes highly relevant to the aggressive phenotype such as nuclear transport, regulation of gene expression, vesicular trafficking, evasion of the immune response, invasion, metastasis, and in resistance to chemotherapy. These proteins may represent a source of information which has the potential to be evaluated for the design of therapies directed against these malignant cells that reside on ovarian cancer ascites.},

abstract = {White adipose tissue (WAT) is a highly adaptive endocrine organ that continuously remodels in response to nutritional cues. WAT expands to store excess energy by increasing adipocyte number and/or size. Failure in WAT expansion has serious consequences on metabolic health resulting in altered lipid, glucose, and inflammatory profiles. Besides an impaired adipogenesis, fibrosis and low-grade inflammation also characterize dysfunctional WAT. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms leading to impaired WAT expansibility are yet unresolved. Autophagy is a conserved and essential process for cellular homeostasis, which constitutively allows the recycling of damaged or long-lived proteins and organelles, but is also highly induced under stress conditions to provide nutrients and remove pathogens. By modulating protein and organelle content, autophagy is also essential for cell remodeling, maintenance, and survival. In this line, autophagy has been involved in many processes affected during WAT maladaptation, including adipogenesis, adipocyte, and macrophage function, inflammatory response, and fibrosis. WAT autophagy dysregulation is related to obesity and diabetes. However, it remains unclear whether WAT autophagy alteration in obese and diabetic patients are the cause or the consequence of WAT malfunction. In this review, current data regarding these issues are discussed, focusing on evidence from human studies.},

abstract = {Central to the process of macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is the formation of autophagosomes, double-membrane vesicles that sequester cytoplasmic cargo, including proteins, lipids and organelles, for lysosomal degradation and macromolecule recycling. Tight regulation of both autophagic activity and capacity is crucial to secure cellular homeostasis and aberrant autophagy is tightly linked to the development of many human diseases. Hence it is of great importance to accurately measure autophagy progression in health and disease. Members of the human WIPI $\beta$-propeller proteins associate with autophagosomal membranes due to specific phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3. P) binding at the onset of autophagy. The specific autophagosomal localization of both WIPI1 and WIPI2 (refered to as WIPI puncta) has been employed to assess autophagy using fluorescence microscopy methods, such as confocal and live-cell video microscopy and was extended for automated high-throughput image acquisition and analyses procedures. We here provide an overview on the employment of human WIPI members for the assessment of autophagy in higher eukaryotic cells, suitable for systems biology approaches such as mathematical modelling.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a cellular bulk degradation system for long-lived proteins and organelles that operates during nutrient starvation and is thus a type of recycling system. In recent years, a series of mammalian orthologs of yeast autophagy-related (ATG) genes have been identified; however, the importance of the transcriptional regulation of ATG genes underlying autophagosome formation is poorly understood. In this study, we identified several ATG genes, including the genes ULK1, MAP1LC3B, GABARAPL1, ATG13, WIPI1, and WDR45/WIPI4, with elevated mRNA levels in thapsigargin-, C2-ceramide-, and rapamycin-treated as well as amino acid-depleted HeLa cells except for MAP1LC3B mRNA in rapamycin-treated HeLa cells. Rapamycin had a weaker effect on the expressions of ATG genes. The increase in WIPI1 and MAP1LC3B mRNA was induced prior to the accumulation of the autophagy marker protein MAP1LC3 in the thapsigargin- and C2-ceramide-treated A549 cells. By counting the puncta marked with MAP1LC3B in HeLa cells treated with different autophagy inducers, we revealed that the time-dependent mRNA elevation of a specific set of ATG genes was similar to that of autophagosome accumulation. The transcriptional attenuation of WIPI1 mRNA using RNA interference inhibited the puncta number in thapsigargin-treated HeLa cells. Remarkably, increases in the abundance of WIPI1 mRNA were also manifested in thapsigargin- and C2-ceramide-treated human fibroblasts (WI-38 and TIG-1), human cancer cells (U-2 OS, Saos-2, and MCF7), and rodent fibroblasts (Rat-1). Taken together, these results suggest that the detection of WIPI1 mRNA is likely to be a convenient method of monitoring autophagosome formation in a wide range of cell types.},

In the mechanisms that generate adaptive and non-adaptive changes in genomes, segmental duplications (duplication of individual genes or genomic regions) and polyploidization (whole genome duplications) are well-known driving forces. The probability of fixation and maintenance of duplicates depends on many variables, including population sizes and selection regimes experienced by the corresponding genes: a combination of stochastic and adaptive mechanisms has shaped all genomes. A survey of experimental work shows that the distinction made between fixation and maintenance of duplicates still needs to be conceptualized and mathematically modeled. Here we review the mechanisms that increase or decrease the probability of fixation or maintenance of duplicated genes, and examine the outcome of these events on the adaptation of the organisms.},

Knowledge of the central transcription factors (TFs), the noncoding gene regulatory regions that they bind to, and the genes whose expression they modulate will be crucial in unlocking the full therapeutic potential of these cells. Here, we use DNase-seq in combination with analysis of histone modifications to identify multiple classes of epigenetically and functionally distinct cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Through motif analysis and ChIP-seq, we identify several of the crucial TF regulators of NS cells. At the core of the network are TFs of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), nuclear factor I (NFI), SOX, and FOX families, with CREs often densely bound by several of these different TFs. We use machine learning to highlight several crucial regulatory features of the network that underpin NS cell self-renewal and multipotency. We validate our predictions by functional analysis of the bHLH TF OLIG2. This TF makes an important contribution to NS cell self-renewal by concurrently activating pro-proliferation genes and preventing the untimely activation of genes promoting neuronal differentiation and stem cell quiescence.},

Vacuolization often accompanies cell death; however, its role in cell death processes remains unclear. This can be attributed to studying vacuolization at the level of morphology for many years. At the same time, new data on the molecular mechanisms of the vacuole formation and structure have become available. In addition, numerous examples of the association between vacuolization and previously unknown cell death types have been reported. Here, we review these data to make a deeper insight into the role of cytoplasmic vacuolization in cell death and survival.},

These TSSs were clustered into 30,964 clusters that were separated from each other by more than 500 bp and thus are very likely to constitute mutually distinct alternative promoters. To our surprise, at least 7674 (52{\%}) human RefSeq genes were subject to regulation by putative alternative promoters (PAPs). On average, there were 3.1 PAPs per gene, with the composition of one CpG-island-containing promoter per 2.6 CpG-less promoters. In 17{\%} of the PAP-containing loci, tissue-specific use of the PAPs was observed. The richest tissue sources of the tissue-specific PAPs were testis and brain. It was also intriguing that the PAP-containing promoters were enriched in the genes encoding signal transduction-related proteins and were rarer in the genes encoding extracellular proteins, possibly reflecting the varied functional requirement for and the restricted expression of those categories of genes, respectively. The patterns of the first exons were highly diverse as well. On average, there were 7.7 different splicing types of first exons per locus partly produced by the PAPs, suggesting that a wide variety of transcripts can be achieved by this mechanism. Our findings suggest that use of alternate promoters and consequent alternative use of first exons should play a pivotal role in generating the complexity required for the highly elaborated molecular systems in humans.},

abstract = {The identification of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in regions of recurrent aneuploidy is a major challenge of molecular cancer research. Using both oligonucleotide single-nucleotide polymorphism and mRNA expression arrays, we integrated genomic and transcriptional information to identify and prioritize candidate cancer genes in regions of increased and decreased chromosomal copy number in a cohort of primary breast cancers. Confirming the validity of this approach, several regions of previously-known copy number (CN) alterations in breast cancer could be successfully reidentified. Focusing on regions of decreased CN, we defined a prioritized list of eighteen candidate genes, which included ARPIN, FBN1, and LZTS1, previously shown to be associated with cancers in breast or other tissue types, and novel genes such as P29, MORF4L1, and TBC1D5. One such gene, the RUNX3 transcription factor, was selected for further study. We show that RUNX3 is present at reduced CNs in proportion to the rest of the tumor genome and that RUNX3 CN reductions can also be observed in a breast cancer series from a different center. Using tissue microarrays, we demonstrate in an independent cohort of over 120 breast tissues that RUNX3 protein is expressed in normal breast epithelium but not fat and stromal tissue, and widely down-regulated in the majority of breast cancers ({\textgreater}85{\{}{\%}{\}}). In vitro, RUNX3 overexpression suppressed the invasive potential of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a matrigel assay. Our results demonstrate the utility of integrative genomic approaches to identify novel potential cancer-related genes in primary tumors.

abstract = {The selective clearance of organelles by autophagy is critical for the regulation of cellular homeostasis in organisms from yeast to humans. Removal of damaged organelles clears the cell of potentially toxic byproducts and enables reuse of organelle components for bioenergetics. Thus, defects in organelle clearance may be detrimental to the health of the cells, contributing to cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory diseases. Organelle-specific autophagy can clear mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, ER, chloroplasts, and the nucleus. Here, we review our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the clearance of organelles by autophagy and highlight gaps in our knowledge of these processes.},

abstract = {Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH) has emerged as an important factor in setting the redox status of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. An important role of H6PDH is to generate a high NADPH/NADP(+) ratio which permits 11$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11$\beta$-HSD1) to act as an oxo-reductase, catalysing the activation of glucocorticoids (GCs). In H6PDH knockout mice 11$\beta$-HSD1 assumes dehydrogenase activity and inactivates GCs, rendering the target cell relatively GC insensitive. Consequently, H6PDHKO mice have a phenotype consistent with defects in the permissive and adaptive actions of GCs upon physiology. H6PDHKO mice have also offered an insight into muscle physiology as they also present with a severe vacuolating myopathy, abnormalities of glucose homeostasis and activation of the unfolded protein response due to ER stress, and a number of mechanisms driving this phenotype are thought to be involved. This article will review what we understand of the redox control of GC hormone metabolism regulated by H6PDH, and how H6PDHKO mice have allowed an in-depth understanding of its potentially novel, GC-independent roles in muscle physiology.},

abstract = {Although metastasis is the most lethal consequence of tumor progression, comparatively little is known regarding the molecular machinery governing this process. In many carcinomas, there is a robust correlation between the expression of the transcription factor Snail and a poor prognosis, but the contribution of this protein to the metastatic process remains unresolved. Interestingly, the prolonged expression of Snail in epidermal keratinocytes is sufficient to recapitulate early features of metastasis. However, it does so without inducing a complete epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a developmental phenomenon mediated by Snail that is extensively invoked as the mechanism fueling tumorigenesis. Instead, we found that the local invasiveness of keratinocytes is the consequence of the recruitment and activity of macrophages. Moreover, keratinocyte proliferation is the product of an IL-17/IL-6/Stat3 signaling module initiated by activated resident gammadeltaT cells in the transgenic skin. Together, these phenotypes prime the transgenic skin for the formation and metastasis of tumors in response to chemically induced carcinogenesis. Thus, the contribution of Snail to the progression of carcinomas is largely through the creation of a hyperproliferative and inflammatory niche that facilitates tumor development and dissemination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of high-throughput omics technologies enabled genome-wide measurements of the activity of cellular elements and provides the analytical resources for the progress of the Systems Biology discipline. Analysis and interpretation of gene expression data has evolved from the gene to the pathway and interaction level, i.e. from the detection of differentially expressed genes, to the establishment of gene interaction networks and the identification of enriched functional categories. Still, the understanding of biological systems requires a further level of analysis that addresses the characterization of the interaction between functional modules.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present a novel computational methodology to study the functional interconnections among the molecular elements of a biological system. The PANA approach uses high-throughput genomics measurements and a functional annotation scheme to extract an activity profile from each functional block -or pathway- followed by machine-learning methods to infer the relationships between these functional profiles. The result is a global, interconnected network of pathways that represents the functional cross-talk within the molecular system. We have applied this approach to describe the functional transcriptional connections during the yeast cell cycle and to identify pathways that change their connectivity in a disease condition using an Alzheimer example.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: PANA is a useful tool to deepen in our understanding of the functional interdependences that operate within complex biological systems. We show the approach is algorithmically consistent and the inferred network is well supported by the available functional data. The method allows the dissection of the molecular basis of the functional connections and we describe the different regulatory mechanisms that explain the network's topology obtained for the yeast cell cycle data.},

A powerful high-throughput method for analyzing single cells is flow cytometry. Several groups have attempted to analyze and sort freshly isolated adipocytes; however, using an adipocyte-specific reporter mouse, we demonstrate that these studies fail to detect the majority of white adipocytes. We define critical settings required for adipocyte flow cytometry and provide a rigid strategy for analyzing and sorting white and brown adipocyte populations. The applicability of our protocol is shown by sorting mouse adipocytes based on size or UCP1 expression and demonstrating that a subset of human adipocytes lacks the $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor, particularly in the insulin-resistant state. In conclusion, the present study confers key technological insights for analyzing and sorting mature adipocytes, opening up numerous downstream research applications. Freshly isolated adipocytes are a notoriously difficult cell type to study.

abstract = {Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is a major cause of lower urinary tract symptoms, with an increased volume of transitional zone and associated with increased stromal cells. It is known that androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a key role in development of BPH, and that blockade of this signaling decreases BPH volume and can relieve lower urinary tract symptoms, but the mechanisms of androgen/AR signaling in BPH development remain unclear, and the effectiveness of current drugs for treating BPH is still limited. The detailed mechanisms of androgen/AR signaling need to be clarified, and new therapies are needed for better treatment of BPH patients. This review focuses on roles of AR in epithelial and stromal cells in BPH development. In epithelial cells, AR may contribute to BPH development via epithelial cell-stromal cell interaction with alterations of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, leading to proliferation of stromal cells. Data from several mouse models with selective knockout of AR in stromal smooth-muscle cells and/or fibroblasts indicate that the AR in stromal cells can also promote BPH development. In prostatic inflammation, AR roles in infiltrating macrophages and epithelial and stromal cells have been linked to BPH development, which has led to discovery of new therapeutic targets. For example, targeting AR with the novel AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9 offers a potential therapeutic approach against BPH development.

Despite recent advances in hormonal, immunologic, bone-targeted, and cytotoxic chemotherapies, treatment resistance and further dissemination are inevitable in men with metastatic disease. Emerging data suggests that the phenomenon of epithelial plasticity, encompassing both reversible mesenchymal transitions and acquisition of stemness traits, may underlie this lethal biology of dissemination and treatment resistance. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of this cellular plasticity from preclinical models of prostate cancer and from biomarker studies of human metastatic prostate cancer has provided clues to novel therapeutic approaches that may delay or prevent metastatic disease and lethality over time.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) is an endogenous inhibitor of toll-like receptors, a superfamily that plays a pivotal role in various pathological conditions, including myocardial infarction (MI). However, the exact role of Tollip in MI remains unknown. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: MI models were established in Tollip knockout (KO) mice, mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of human Tollip gene and in their Tollip(+/+) and non-transgenic controls respectively. The effects of Tollip on MI were evaluated by mortality, infarct size and cardiac function. Hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte damage was investigated in vitro to confirm the role of Tollip in heart damage. KEY RESULTS: Tollip expression was dramatically up-regulated in human ischaemic hearts and infarcted mice hearts. MI-induced mortality, infarct size and cardiac dysfunction were decreased in Tollip-KO mice compared with Tollip(+/+) controls. Ischaemic hearts from Tollip-KO mice exhibited decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and reduced NF-kappaB activation. Tollip depletion also alleviated myocardial apoptosis by down-regulating pro-apoptotic protein levels and up-regulating anti-apoptotic protein expressions in infarct border zone. Conversely, MI effects were exacerbated in mice with cardiac-specific Tollip overexpression. This aggravated MI injury by Tollip in vivo was confirmed with in vitro assays. Inhibition of Akt signalling was associated with the detrimental effects of Tollip on MI injury; activation of Akt largely reversed the deleterious effects of Tollip on MI-induced cardiomyocyte death. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Tollip promotes inflammatory and apoptotic responses after MI, leading to increased mortality and aggravated cardiac dysfunction. These findings suggest that Tollip may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of MI.},

Recently, TET1 was found to hydroxylate the methyl group of mC, converting it to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (hmC). Here we show that TET1 binds throughout the genome of embryonic stem cells, with the majority of binding sites located at transcription start sites (TSSs) of CpG-rich promoters and within genes. The hmC modification is found in gene bodies and in contrast to mC is also enriched at CpG-rich TSSs. We provide evidence further that TET1 has a role in transcriptional repression. TET1 binds a significant proportion of Polycomb group target genes. Furthermore, TET1 associates and colocalizes with the SIN3A co-repressor complex. We propose that TET1 fine-tunes transcription, opposes aberrant DNA methylation at CpG-rich sequences and thereby contributes to the regulation of DNA methylation fidelity.},

abstract = {Cell differentiation, proliferation and migration are essential processes in tissue regeneration. Experimental evidence confirms that cell differentiation or proliferation can be regulated according to the extracellular matrix stiffness. For instance, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate to neuroblast, chondrocyte or osteoblast within matrices mimicking the stiffness of their native substrate. However, the precise mechanisms by which the substrate stiffness governs cell differentiation or proliferation are not well known. Therefore, a mechano-sensing computational model is here developed to elucidate how substrate stiffness regulates cell differentiation and/or proliferation during cell migration. In agreement with experimental observations, it is assumed that internal deformation of the cell (a mechanical signal) together with the cell maturation state directly coordinates cell differentiation and/or proliferation. Our findings indicate that MSC differentiation to neurogenic, chondrogenic or osteogenic lineage specifications occurs within soft (0.1-1 kPa), intermediate (20-25 kPa) or hard (30-45 kPa) substrates, respectively. These results are consistent with well-known experimental observations. Remarkably, when a MSC differentiate to a compatible phenotype, the average net traction force depends on the substrate stiffness in such a way that it might increase in intermediate and hard substrates but it would reduce in a soft matrix. However, in all cases the average net traction force considerably increases at the instant of cell proliferation because of cell-cell interaction. Moreover cell differentiation and proliferation accelerate with increasing substrate stiffness due to the decrease in the cell maturation time. Thus, the model provides insights to explain the hypothesis that substrate stiffness plays a key role in regulating cell fate during mechanotaxis.},

Abnormal autophagic protein degradation has been associated with multiple human diseases such as cancer, neurological disability and cardiovascular disease; therefore, further elucidation of protein degradation by autophagy may be beneficial for protein-based clinical therapies. Macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) can both participate in selective protein degradation in mammalian cells, but the process is quite different in each case. Here, we summarize the various types of macroautophagy and CMA involved in determining protein degradation. For this summary, we divide the autophagic protein degradation pathways into four categories: the post-translational modification dependent and independent CMA pathways and the ubiquitin dependent and independent macroautophagy pathways, and describe how some non-canonical pathways and modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation and arginylation can influence protein degradation by the autophagy lysosome system (ALS). Finally, we comment on why autophagy can serve as either diagnostics or therapeutic targets in different human diseases.},

DANCR (anti-differentiation noncoding RNA) is a newly identified lncRNA in human cancer, however, its functional roles and clinical value in gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of DANCR in the tumor tissues and serum of GC patients and analyzed the correlation between DANCR expression levels and the clinicopathological characteristics. Our results showed that the expression of DANCR was higher in the tumor tissues than that in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The expression level of DANCR was also elevated in the serum of GC patients compared to that of healthy controls. The expression levels of DANCR were significantly associated with tumor size, TNM stage, lymphatic metastasis and invasion depth. DANCR knockdown inhibited the proliferation of GC cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. In addition, DANCR knockdown suppressed gastric cancer growth in vivo. Moreover, DANCR knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of GC cells via the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, DANCR overexpression had the opposite effect. DANCR is activated by SALL4 in gastric cancer cells and exerted its oncogenic activities through the activation of $\beta$-catenin pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that DANCR promotes the progression of gastric cancer and have the potential to serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker.},

abstract = {While conventional LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglyceride measurements reflect aggregate properties of plasma lipoprotein fractions, NMR-based measurements more accurately reflect lipoprotein particle concentrations according to class (LDL, HDL, and VLDL) and particle size (small, medium, and large). The concentrations of these lipoprotein sub-fractions may be related to risk of cardiovascular disease and related metabolic disorders. We performed a genome-wide association study of 17 lipoprotein measures determined by NMR together with LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, ApoA1, and ApoB in 17,296 women from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS). Among 36 loci with genome-wide significance (P{\textless}5x10(-8)) in primary and secondary analysis, ten (PCCB/STAG1 (3q22.3), GMPR/MYLIP (6p22.3), BTNL2 (6p21.32), KLF14 (7q32.2), 8p23.1, JMJD1C (10q21.3), SBF2 (11p15.4), 12q23.2, CCDC92/DNAH10/ZNF664 (12q24.31.B), and WIPI1 (17q24.2)) have not been reported in prior genome-wide association studies for plasma lipid concentration. Associations with mean lipoprotein particle size but not cholesterol content were found for LDL at four loci (7q11.23, LPL (8p21.3), 12q24.31.B, and LIPG (18q21.1)) and for HDL at one locus (GCKR (2p23.3)). In addition, genetic determinants of total IDL and total VLDL concentration were found at many loci, most strongly at LIPC (15q22.1) and APOC-APOE complex (19q13.32), respectively. Associations at seven more loci previously known for effects on conventional plasma lipid measures reveal additional genetic influences on lipoprotein profiles and bring the total number of loci to 43. Thus, genome-wide associations identified novel loci involved with lipoprotein metabolism-including loci that affect the NMR-based measures of concentration or size of LDL, HDL, and VLDL particles-all characteristics of lipoprotein profiles that may impact disease risk but are not available by conventional assay.},

abstract = {RNA polymerase (pol) III transcribes a variety of small untranslated RNAs involved in transcription, RNA processing, and translation. RNA pol III and its components are altered in various human developmental disorders, yet their roles in cell fate determination and development are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that Maf1, a transcriptional repressor, promotes induction of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into mesoderm. Reduced Maf1 expression in mESCs and preadipocytes impairs adipogenesis, while ectopic Maf1 expression in Maf1-deficient cells enhances differentiation. RNA pol III repression by chemical inhibition or knockdown of Brf1 promotes adipogenesis. Altered RNA pol III-dependent transcription produces select changes in mRNAs with a significant enrichment of adipogenic gene signatures. Furthermore, RNA pol III-mediated transcription positively regulates long non-coding RNA H19 and Wnt6 expression, established adipogenesis inhibitors. Together, these studies reveal an important and unexpected function for RNA pol III-mediated transcription and Maf1 in mesoderm induction and adipocyte differentiation. Maf1 and RNA pol III transcription repression play a key role in cell fate determination by promoting mesoderm induction and adipocyte differentiation. Chen et al. show that alterations in RNA pol III transcription produce select changes in adipogenic genes, and inhibitory factors including Wnt6 and H19lnc RNA, to regulate adipogenesis.},

@article{Lin2010,
abstract = {Melanoma is a highly metastatic cancer, and there are no current therapeutic modalities to treat this deadly malignant disease once it has metastasized. Melanoma cancers exhibit B-RAF mutations in up to 70{\%} of cases. B-RAF mutations are responsible, in large part, for the constitutive hyperactivation of survival/antiapoptotic pathways such as the MAPK, NF-$\kappa$B, and PI3K/AKT. These hyperactivated pathways regulate the expression of genes targeting the initiation of the metastatic cascade, namely, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is the result of the expression of mesenchymal gene products such as fibronectin, vimentin, and metalloproteinases and the invasion and inhibition of E-cadherin. The above pathways cross-talk and regulate each other's activities and functions. For instance, the NF-$\kappa$B pathway directly regulates EMT through the transcription of gene products involved in EMT and indirectly through the transcriptional up-regulation of the metastasis inducer Snail. Snail, in turn, suppresses the expression of the metastasis suppressor gene product Raf kinase inhibitor protein RKIP (inhibits the MAPK and the NF-$\kappa$B pathways) as well as PTEN (inhibits the PI3K/AKT pathway). The role of B-RAF mutations in melanoma and their direct role in the induction of EMT are not clear. This review discusses the hypothesis that B-RAF mutations are involved in the dysregulation of the NF-$\kappa$B/Snail/RKIP/PTEN circuit and in both the induction of EMT and metastasis. The therapeutic implications of the dysregulation of the above circuit by B-RAF mutations are such that they offer novel targets for therapeutic interventions in the treatment of EMT and metastasis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process in carcinogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In our previous studies, we found that neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is overexpressed in tongue squamous cell carcinoma and that this overexpression is associated with cell migration and invasion. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B) plays an essential role both in the induction and the maintenance of EMT and tumor metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that NRP1 induces EMT, and that NRP1-induced migration and invasion may be an important mechanism for promoting invasion and metastasis of OSCC through NF-$\kappa$B activation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS/RESULTS: The variations in gene and protein expression and the changes in the biological behavior of OSCC cell lines transfected with a vector encoding NRP1, or the corresponding vector control, were evaluated. NRP1 overexpression promoted EMT and was associated with enhanced invasive and metastatic properties. Furthermore, the induction of EMT promoted the acquisition of some cancer stem cell (CSC)-like characteristics in OSCC cells. We addressed whether selective inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B suppresses the NRP1-mediated EMT by treating cells with pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate ammonium (PDTC), an inhibitor of NF-$\kappa$B. Immunohistochemical analysis of NRP1 in OSCC tissue samples further supported a key mediator role for NRP1 in tumor progression, lymph node metastasis, and indicated that NRP1 is a predictor for poor prognosis in OSCC patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate that NRP1 may regulate the EMT process in OSCC cell lines through NF-$\kappa$B activation, and that higher NRP1 expression levels are associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in OSCC patients. Further investigation of the role of NRP1 in tumorigenesis may help identify novel targets for the prevention and therapy of oral cancers.},

As yet, the influence of long-term therapy with orlistat on PYYand GLP-1 release has not been studied. Our study was aimed at assessing the influence of 8-week therapy with orlistat as a component of a weight loss program on pre-prandial circulating PYY and GLP-1 levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Forty obese women, without concomitant diseases, were randomly allocated to groups receiving orlistat or placebo during an 8-week weight management program. Body mass, body composition and plasma levels of PYY, GLP-1 and insulin (for QUICKI calculation) were determined prior to and at the end of therapy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Women treated with orlistat obtained significantly greater body and fat mass loss than those receiving placebo (9.0 ± 3.1 vs. 5.9 ± 3.2{\%} and 21.9 ± 10.9 vs. 7.4 ± 15.6{\%}, respectively). Only in those treated with orlistat a slight, but significant increase of the QUICKI was found (8.0 ± 16.5 vs. -0.1 ± 12.7 {\%}, respectively). Weight loss was followed by a significant increase of plasma levels of PYY and GLP-1 in group treated with orlistat, and was about 2-times greater than receiving placebo. The increase was independent of body mass changes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The long-term inhibition of intestinal lipase by orlistat increases the pre-prandial levels of GLP-1 and PYY, independent of body mass changes. Therefore, it seems that long-term treatment with orlistat may exert hunger suppressing and insulin sensitizing incretin effect beyond weight reduction.},

This review examines recent research on the role of signaling pathways and transcription factors regulating EMT-like processes in melanoma and their association with response to therapy in patients, especially response to BRAF inhibition, which is initially effective but limited by development of resistance and subsequent progression. We highlight studies implicating specific roles of various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in advancing melanoma progression by conferring a proliferative advantage and through promoting invasive phenotypes and metastasis. We also review the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying resistance to BRAF inhibition and the potential role of melanoma phenotype switching in this process. In particular, we discuss how these important new insights may significantly enhance our ability to predict patterns of melanoma progression during treatment, and may facilitate rational development of combination therapies in the future.},

abstract = {The signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5, trisphosphate (PIP3) is an essential mediator of many vital cellular processes, including growth, survival, and metabolism. PIP3 is generated through the action of the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), and their activity is tightly controlled through interactions with regulatory proteins and activating stimuli. The class IA PI3Ks are composed of three distinct p110 catalytic subunits (p110$\alpha$, p110$\beta$, and p110$\delta$), and they play different roles in specific tissues due to disparities in both expression and engagement downstream of cell-surface recep-tors. Disruption of PI3K regulation is a frequent driver of numerous human diseases. Activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene encoding the p110$\alpha$ catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K are frequently mutated in several cancer types, and mutations in the PIK3CD gene encoding the p110$\delta$ catalytic subunit have been identified in primary immunode-ficiency patients. All class IA p110 subunits interact with p85 regulatory subunits, and mutations/deletions in different p85 regulatory subunits have been identified in both cancer and primary immunodeficiencies. In this review, we will summarize our current understanding for the molecular basis of how class IA PI3K catalytic activity is regulated by p85 regulatory subunits, and how activating mutations in the PI3K catalytic subunits PIK3CA and PIK3CD (p110$\alpha$, p110$\delta$) and regulatory subunits PIK3R1 (p85$\alpha$) mediate PI3K activation and human disease.},

abstract = {The differentiation of most mammalian cells is preceded by growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but the characteristics of this state have not been established. We now report that the growth arrest that precedes the differentiation of BALB/c 3T3 T mouse proadipocytes must occur at a distinct state in G1 designated GD. GD-arrested cells are characterized by their ability to differentiate in the absence of DNA synthesis and by their unique sensitivity to the mitogenic effect of isobutylmethylxanthine. Proadipocytes induced to become G1 growth arrested at other states by culture in medium deficient in growth factor or nutrients, by contrast, are unable to differentiate in the absence of DNA synthesis and are not stimulated to proliferate by isobutylmethylxanthine even when they are exposed to differentiation-promoting medium prior to arrest. These data support the conclusion that, prior to the expression of a differentiated phenotype, proadipocytes must arrest their growth at a distinct state in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, GD. These data also provide the basis for the hypothesis that carcinogenesis is associated with defects in the coupling of growth arrest and differentiation at the GD state.},

abstract = {Downregulation of Mucin 2 (MUC2) expression is associated with early carcinogenesis events in colon cancer. MUC2 plays a role in the progression of colon cancer, and reduced MUC2 protein expression correlates with increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. However, the interaction between MUC2 and IL-6 in colorectal cancer metastasis remains unclear. We systematically analyzed MUC2 and IL-6 expression and determined the survival of cancer patients with high or low MUC2 and IL-6 expression using the Oncomine and PrognoScan databases, respectively. This analysis identified downregulation of MUC2 and overexpression of IL-6 in colon cancer but not in normal colon tissue, and this expression pattern was correlated with poor survival of colon cancer patients. We examined the effects of MUC2 on colon cancer metastasis and used vector-mediated application of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to suppress MUC2 expression. MUC2 suppressed the migration of colon cancer cells in vitro and dramatically diminished liver metastases in vivo. Treatment with IL-6 increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, promoted checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) activation, attenuated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, and suppressed E-cadherin protein expression in MUC2-silenced HT-29 cancer cells. Most importantly, MUC2 is a potential prognostic indicator for colon cancer. The secretory protein mucin 2 (MUC2) is the primary component of the protective mucus layer of the colon and plays a role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) 1 . MUC2 expression is attenuated in nonmucinous colon adenocarcinomas (ACs) but preserved in mucinous colon carcinomas. Previous studies have reported that the loss of MUC2 expression is a poor prognostic factor in stage II and III colorectal carcinoma 2 . Loss of MUC2 expression is observed in CRC and is associated with progression and metastasis 3–5 . Moreover, MUC2 expres-sion is correlated with better survival and a decreased incidence of liver and nodal metastasis in colon AC 2, 6 . Furthermore, MUC2 expression tends to predict a good prognosis in well-to-moderately differentiated AC but not in poorly differentiated AC 7, 8 . Altered MUC2 expression may contribute to changes in the invasive and met-astatic capabilities of the cancer 9, 10 . Therefore, MUC2 may play an important role in colon carcinoma metastasis and predict cancer recurrence. Various studies have reported that elevated IL-6 levels are associated with advanced tumor stages, increased tumor size, metastasis, and decreased survival of CRC patients 11–14 . Low preoperative levels of IL-6 are signifi-cantly associated with a longer disease-free survival in stage I-III colon cancer patients 15 . In addition, high serum IL-6 is a risk factor for CRC recurrence, including in stage II patients 15 . IL-6 is an important mediator of the tumor-promoting effects of inflammation 16 . In previous studies, tumor-infiltrating macrophages were shown to express a high level of IL-6 17, 18 . Understanding IL-6-mediated signaling may facilitate the design of better cancer therapeutics.},

abstract = {Micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA segments that have a role in the regulation of normal cellular development and proliferation including normal osteogenesis. They exert their effects through inhibition of specific target genes at the post-transcriptional level. Many miRNAs have altered expression levels in cancer (either increased or decreased depending on the specific miRNA). Altered miRNA expression profiles have been identified in several malignancies including primary bone tumors such as osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. It is thought that they may function as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes and hence when dysregulated contribute to the initiation and progression of malignancy. miRNAs are also thought to have a role in the development of bone metastases in other malignancies. In addition, evidence increasingly suggests that miRNAs may play a part in determining the response to chemotherapy in the treatment of osteosarcoma. These molecules are readily detectable in tissues, both fresh and formalin fixed paraffin embedded and, more recently, in blood. Although there are fewer published studies regarding circulating miRNA profiles, they appear to reflect changes in tissue expression. Thus miRNAs may serve as potential indicators of disease presence but more importantly, may have a role in disease characterization or as potential therapeutic targets. This review gives a brief overview of miRNA biochemistry and explores the evidence to date implicating these small molecules in the pathogenesis of bone tumors.},

However, a systematic effort to identify disease candidates within the human epigenetic machinery (EM) has not been performed, and it is unclear whether features exist that distinguish between variation-intolerant and variation-tolerant EM genes, and between EM genes associated with neurologi-cal dysfunction versus cancer. Here, we rigorously define a set of 295 human genes with a direct role in epigenetic regulation (writers, erasers, remodelers, readers). Sys-tematic exploration of these genes reveals that while individual enzymatic functions are always mutually exclusive, readers often also exhibit enzymatic activity as well (dual function EM genes). We find that the majority of EM genes are very intoler-ant to loss-of-function variation, even when compared to the dosage sensitive group of transcription factors. Using this strategy, we identify 103 novel EM disease can-didates. We show that the intolerance to loss-of-function variation is driven by the protein domains encoding the epigenetic function, strongly suggesting that disease is caused by a perturbed chromatin state. Unexpectedly, we also describe a large sub-set of EM genes that are co-expressed within multiple tissues. This subset is almost exclusively populated by extremely variation-intolerant EM genes, and shows enrich-ment for dual function EM genes. It is also highly enriched for genes associated with},

abstract = {Elucidating targets of physiological tumor metastasis suppressors can highlight key signaling pathways leading to invasion and metastasis. To identify downstream targets of the metastasis suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP/PEBP1), we utilized an integrated approach based upon statistical analysis of tumor gene expression data combined with experimental validation. Previous studies from our laboratory identified the architectural transcription factor and oncogene, high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), as a target of inhibition by RKIP. Here we identify two signaling pathways that promote HMGA2-driven metastasis. Using both human breast tumor cells and an MMTV-Wnt mouse breast tumor model, we show that RKIP induces and HMGA2 inhibits expression of miR-200b; miR-200b directly inhibits expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX), leading to decreased invasion. RKIP also inhibits syndecan-2 (SDC2), which is aberrantly expressed in breast cancer, via downregulation of HMGA2; but this mechanism is independent of miR-200. Depletion of SDC2 induces apoptosis and suppresses breast tumor growth and metastasis in mouse xenografts. RKIP, LOX and SDC2 are coordinately regulated and collectively encompass a prognostic signature for metastasis-free survival in ER-negative breast cancer patients. Taken together, our findings reveal two novel signaling pathways targeted by the metastasis suppressor RKIP that regulate remodeling of the extracellular matrix and tumor survival.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a major effector in insulin signaling. rs361072, located in the promoter of the gene (PIK3CB) for the p110beta subunit, has previously been found to be associated with homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in obese subjects. The aim was to investigate the influence of rs361072 on in vivo glucose metabolism, skeletal muscle PI3K subunit protein levels, and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The functional role of rs361072 was studied in 196 Danish healthy adult twins. Peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity was assessed by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Basal and insulin-stimulated biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle, and tissue p110beta and p85alpha proteins were measured by Western blotting. The genetic association with type 2 diabetes and quantitative metabolic traits was investigated in 9,316 Danes with glucose tolerance ranging from normal to overt type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: While hepatic insulin resistance was similar in the fasting state, carriers of the minor G allele had lower hepatic glucose output (per-allele effect: -16{\%}, P(add) = 0.004) during high physiological insulin infusion. rs361072 did not associate with insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose disposal despite a decreased muscle p85alpha:p110beta protein ratio (P(add) = 0.03) in G allele carriers. No association with HOMA-IR or type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.07, P = 0.5) was identified, and obesity did not interact with rs361072 on these traits. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the minor G allele of PIK3CB rs361072 associates with decreased muscle p85alpha:p110beta ratio and lower hepatic glucose production at high plasma insulin levels. However, no impact on type 2 diabetes prevalence was found.},

Little is known about the nature of AR cis-regulatory sites in the human genome. We have mapped the AR binding regions on two chromosomes in human prostate cancer cells by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with tiled oligonucleotide microarrays. We find that the majority of AR binding regions contain noncanonical AR-responsive elements (AREs). Importantly, we identify a noncanonical ARE as a cis-regulatory target of AR action in TMPRSS2, a gene fused to ETS transcription factors in the majority of prostate cancers. In addition, through the presence of enriched DNA-binding motifs, we find other transcription factors including GATA2 and Oct1 that cooperate in mediating the androgen response. These collaborating factors, together with AR, form a regulatory hierarchy that governs androgen-dependent gene expression and prostate cancer growth and offer potential new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) activation is a central event in type I interferon production in anti-virus innate immunity. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying TBK1 activation remains unclear. Here we report that Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is essential for TBK1 activation and type I interferon production triggered by viral infection. Upon viral infection, RKIP is phosphorylated at serine 109 (S109) by TBK1. Phosphorylation of RKIP enhances its interaction with TBK1 and in turn promotes TBK1 autophosphorylation. Mutation of RKIP S109 to alanine abrogates the interaction between RKIP and TBK1, and the anti-viral function of RKIP RKIP deficiency inhibits intracellular double-stranded RNA- or DNA-induced type I interferon production. Consistently, RKIP deficiency renders the mice more susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. This study reveals a previously unrecognized positive feedback loop between RKIP and TBK1 that is essential for type I interferon production in anti-viral innate immunity.},

However, the complexity of such high-dimensional data sets makes it difficult to fully understand the underlying biological features present in the data. The aim of this study is to introduce a method for DNA microarray analysis that provides an intuitive interpretation of data through dimension reduction and pattern recognition. We present the first "Archetypal Analysis" of global gene expression. The analysis is based on microarray data from five integrated studies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the airways of cystic fibrosis patients.Results: Our analysis clustered samples into distinct groups with comprehensible characteristics since the archetypes representing the individual groups are closely related to samples present in the data set. Significant changes in gene expression between different groups identified adaptive changes of the bacteria residing in the cystic fibrosis lung. The analysis suggests a similar gene expression pattern between isolates with a high mutation rate (hypermutators) despite accumulation of different mutations for these isolates. This suggests positive selection in the cystic fibrosis lung environment, and changes in gene expression for these isolates are therefore most likely related to adaptation of the bacteria.Conclusions: Archetypal analysis succeeded in identifying adaptive changes of P. aeruginosa. The combination of clustering and matrix factorization made it possible to reveal minor similarities among different groups of data, which other analytical methods failed to identify. We suggest that this analysis could be used to supplement current methods used to analyze DNA microarray data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Th{\o}gersen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression data have become an instrumental resource in describing the molecular state associated with various cellular phenotypes and responses to environmental perturbations. The utility of expression profiling has been demonstrated in partitioning clinical states, predicting the class of unknown samples and in assigning putative functional roles to previously uncharacterized genes based on profile similarity. However, gene expression profiling has had only limited success in identifying therapeutic targets. This is partly due to the fact that current methods based on fold-change focus only on single genes in isolation, and thus cannot convey causal information. In this paper, we present a technique for analysis of expression data in a graph-theoretic framework that relies on associations between genes. We describe the global organization of these networks and biological correlates of their structure. We go on to present a novel technique for the molecular characterization of disparate cellular states that adds a new dimension to the fold-based methods and conclude with an example application to a human medulloblastoma dataset.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We have shown that expression networks generated from large model-organism expression datasets are scale-free and that the average clustering coefficient of these networks is several orders of magnitude higher than would be expected for similarly sized scale-free networks, suggesting an inherent hierarchical modularity similar to that previously identified in other biological networks. Furthermore, we have shown that these properties are robust with respect to the parameters of network construction. We have demonstrated an enrichment of genes having lethal knockout phenotypes in the high-degree (i.e. hub) nodes in networks generated from aggregate condition datasets; using process-focused Saccharomyces cerivisiae datasets we have demonstrated additional high-degree enrichments of condition-specific genes encoding proteins known to be involved in or important for the processes interrogated by the microarrays. These results demonstrate the utility of network analysis applied to expression data in identifying genes that are regulated in a state-specific manner. We concluded by showing that a sample application to a human clinical dataset prominently identified a known therapeutic target.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: Software implementing the methods for network generation presented in this paper is available for academic use by request from the authors in the form of compiled linux binary executables.},

abstract = {MicroRNA-101 has been implicated as a tumor suppressor miRNA in human tumors. However, its potential functional impact and the underlying mechanisms in endometrial cancer progression have not been determined. Here, we report that in aggressive endometrial cancer cells, re-expression of microRNA-101 leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis and senescence. Ectopic overexpression of microRNA-101 attenuates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated cancer cell migration and invasion, abrogates the sphere-forming capacity and enhances chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. Algorithm and microarray-based strategies identifies potential microRNA-101 targets. Among these, we validated EZH2, MCL-1 and FOS as direct targets of miR-101 and silencing of these genes mimics the tumor suppressive effects observed on promoting microRNA-101 function. Importantly, further results suggest an inverse correlation between low miR-101 and high EZH2, MCL-1 and FOS expression in EC specimens. We conclude that, as a crucial tumor suppressor, microRNA-101 suppresses cell proliferation, invasiveness and self-renewal in aggressive endometrial cancer cells via modulating multiple critical oncogenes. The microRNA-101-EZH2/MCL-1/FOS axis is a potential therapeutic target for endometrial cancer.},

abstract = {Typical members of the Ras superfamily of small monomeric GTP-binding proteins function as regulators of diverse processes by cycling between biologically active GTP- and inactive GDP-bound conformations. Proteins that control this cycling include guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GEFs, which activate Ras superfamily members by catalyzing GTP for GDP exchange, and GTPase activating proteins or GAPs, which accelerate the low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of typical Ras superfamily members, thus causing their inactivation. Two among the latter class of proteins have been implicated in common genetic disorders associated with an increased cancer risk, neurofibromatosis-1, and tuberous sclerosis. To facilitate genetic analysis, I surveyed Drosophila and human sequence databases for genes predicting proteins related to GAPs for Ras superfamily members. Remarkably, close to 0.5{\%} of genes in both species (173 human and 64 Drosophila genes) predict proteins related to GAPs for Arf, Rab, Ran, Rap, Ras, Rho, and Sar family GTPases. Information on these genes has been entered into a pair of relational databases, which can be used to identify evolutionary conserved proteins that are likely to serve basic biological functions, and which can be updated when definitive information on the coding potential of both genomes becomes available. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Most cancer deaths are due to the development of metastases, hence the most important improvements in morbidity and mortality will result from prevention (or elimination) of such disseminated disease. Some would argue that treatments directed against metastasis are too late because cells have already escaped from the primary tumour. Such an assertion runs contrary to the significant but (for many common adult cancers) fairly modest improvements in survival following the use of adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy designed to eliminate disseminated cells after surgical removal of the primary tumour. Nonetheless, the debate raises important issues concerning the accurate early identification of clonogenic, metastatic cells, the discovery of novel, tractable targets for therapy, and the monitoring of minimal residual disease. We focus on recent findings regarding intrinsic and extrinsic molecular mechanisms controlling metastasis that determine how, when, and where cancers metastasise, and their implications for patient management in the 21st century. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, how the DNA sequence determines which TF complex forms at any given site is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that high-throughput in vitro binding assays coupled with unbiased computational analysis provides unprecedented insight into how complexes of homeodomain proteins adapt their stoichiometry and configuration to the bound DNA. Using inferred knowledge about minor groove width readout, we design targeted protein mutations that destabilize homeodomain binding in a complex-specific manner. By performing parallel SELEX-seq, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and Hi-C assays, we not only reveal complex-specific functions, but also show that TF binding sites that lack a canonical sequence motif emerge as a consequence of direct interaction with functionally bound sites.},

abstract = {Nuclear receptors are ligand-regulated transcription factors that regulate key aspects of metazoan development, differentiation, and homeostasis. Nuclear receptors recognize target genes by binding to specific DNA recognition sequences, denoted hormone response elements (HREs). Many nuclear receptors can recognize HREs as either homodimers or heterodimers. Retinoid X receptors (RXRs), in particular, serve as important heterodimer partners for many other nuclear receptors, including thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), and RXR/TR heterodimers have been proposed to be the primary mediators of target gene regulation by T3 hormone. Here, we report that the retinoic acid receptors (RARs), a distinct class of nuclear receptors, are also efficient heterodimer partners for TRs. These RAR/TR heterodimers form with similar affinities as RXR/TR heterodimers on an assortment of consensus and natural HREs, and preferentially assemble with the RAR partner 5' of the TR moiety. The corepressor and coactivator recruitment properties of these RAR/TR heterodimers and their transcriptional activities in vivo are distinct from those observed with the corresponding RXR heterodimers. Our studies indicate that RXRs are not unique in their ability to partner with TRs, and that RARs can also serve as robust heterodimer partners and combinatorial regulators of T3-modulated gene expression.},

Here we ask how trade-offs affect the range of phenotypes found in nature. Using the Pareto front concept from economics and engineering, we find that best-trade-off phenotypes are weighted averages of archetypes--phenotypes specialized for single tasks. For two tasks, phenotypes fall on the line connecting the two archetypes, which could explain linear trait correlations, allometric relationships, as well as bacterial gene-expression patterns. For three tasks, phenotypes fall within a triangle in phenotype space, whose vertices are the archetypes, as evident in morphological studies, including on Darwin's finches. Tasks can be inferred from measured phenotypes based on the behavior of organisms nearest the archetypes.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) form large paralogous gene families and have complex  evolutionary histories. Here, we ask whether putative orthologs of TFs, from bidirectional best BLAST hits (BBHs), are evolutionary orthologs with conserved functions. We show that BBHs of TFs from distantly related bacteria are usually not evolutionary orthologs. Furthermore, the false orthologs usually respond to different signals and regulate distinct pathways, while the few BBHs that are evolutionary orthologs do have conserved functions. To test the conservation of regulatory interactions, we analyze expression patterns. We find that regulatory relationships between TFs and their regulated genes are usually not conserved for BBHs in Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis. Even in the much more closely related bacteria Vibrio cholerae and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, predicting regulation from E. coli BBHs has high error rates. Using gene-regulon correlations, we identify genes whose expression pattern differs between E. coli and S. oneidensis. Using literature searches and sequence analysis, we show that these changes in expression patterns reflect changes in gene regulation, even for evolutionary orthologs. We conclude that the evolution of bacterial regulation should be analyzed with phylogenetic trees, rather than BBHs, and that bacterial regulatory networks evolve more rapidly than previously thought.},

Here, we examined the role of two epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators, the adherens junction protein E-cadherin and its transcriptional repressor SNAI1, in regulating the aggressiveness of PCA cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The growth rate of human prostate carcinoma PC3 cells with stable knock-down of E-cadherin (ShEC-PC3) and respective control cells (Sh-PC3) was compared in MTT and clonogenic assays in cell culture and in nude mouse xenograft model in vivo. Stemness of ShEC-PC3 and Sh-PC3 cells was analyzed in prostasphere assay. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to study protein expression changes following E-cadherin and SNAI1 knock-down. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique was employed to knock- down SNAI1 protein expression in ShEC-PC3 cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: ShEC-PC3 cells exerted higher proliferation rate both in cell culture and in athymic nude mice compared to Sh-PC3 cells. ShEC-PC3 cells also formed larger and a significantly higher number of prostaspheres suggesting an increase in the stem cell-like population with E-cadherin knock-down. Also, ShEC-PC3 prostaspheres disintegration, in the presence of serum and attachment, generated a bigger mass of proliferating cells as compared to Sh-PC3 prostaspheres. Immunoblotting/IHC analyses showed that E-cadherin knock-down increases the expression of regulators/biomarkers for stemness (CD44, cleaved Notch1 and Egr-1) and EMT (Vimentin, pSrc-tyr416, Integrin $\beta$3, $\beta$-catenin, and NF-$\kappa$B) in cell culture and xenograft tissues. The expression of several bone metastasis related molecules namely CXCR4, uPA, RANKL and RunX2 was also increased in ShEC-PC3 cells. Importantly, we observed a remarkable increase in SNAI1 expression in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, prostaspheres and xenograft tissues of ShEC-PC3 cells. Furthermore, SNAI1 knock-down by specific siRNA strongly inhibited the prostasphere formation, clonogenicity and invasiveness, and decreased the level of pSrc-tyr416, total Src and CD44 in ShEC-PC3 cells. Characterization of RWPE-1, WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14 and DU-145 cells further confirmed that low E-cadherin is associated with higher SNAI1 expression and prostasphere formation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest that E-cadherin loss promotes SNAI1 expression that controls the aggressiveness of PCA cells.},

abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative, spiral-shaped bacterium that infects more than half of the world's population and is a major cause of gastric adenocarcinoma. The mechanisms that link H. pylori infection to gastric carcinogenesis are not well understood. In the present study, we report that the Raf-kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) has a role in the induction of apoptosis by H. pylori in gastric epithelial cells. Western blot and luciferase transcription reporter assays demonstrate that the pathogenicity island of H. pylori rapidly phosphorylates RKIP, which then localizes to the nucleus where it activates its own transcription and induces apoptosis. Forced overexpression of RKIP enhances apoptosis in H. pylori-infected cells, whereas RKIP RNA inhibition suppresses the induction of apoptosis by H. pylori infection. While inducing the phosphorylation of RKIP, H. pylori simultaneously targets non-phosphorylated RKIP for proteasome-mediated degradation. The increase in RKIP transcription and phosphorylation is abrogated by mutating RKIP serine 153 to valine, demonstrating that regulation of RKIP activity by H. pylori is dependent upon RKIP's S153 residue. In addition, H. pylori infection increases the expression of Snail, a transcriptional repressor of RKIP. Our results suggest that H. pylori utilizes a tumor suppressor protein, RKIP, to promote apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Class IA PI 3-kinases produce phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 is bound by AKT which facilities its activation by PDK1. Activated AKT promotes cell survival and stimulates cell proliferation. Class IA PI 3-kinases are heterodimers consisting of a regulatory subunit p85 and a catalytic subunit p110. The p110alpha isoform has been shown to be mutated in a number of tumor types. A number of recent studies suggest that the p110beta isoform may be functionally relevant in prostate cancer. In this study we extend this work to include the examination of the expression and functional properties of p110alpha and p110beta in three different prostate cancer cell lines, DU145, LNCaP, PC3, as well as the non-tumorigenic but immortalized RWPE1 prostate epithelial cell line. METHODS Western blot analysis was used to measure protein expression and quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels. After targeted knockdown using isoform-specific siRNAs to reduce PI 3-kinase p110alpha or p110beta isoform expression, we measured downstream signally events such as phosphorylation of AKT, ERK 1/2, PDK, and FOXO, as well as biological consequences such as changes in apoptosis, and alterations in cell cycle progression. RESULTS In all three prostate cancer cell lines examined, targeted knockdown of p110beta, and not p110alpha, resulted in significantly reduced AKT, PDK, and FOXO phosphorylation. While knockdown of either p110 isoform resulted in an increase in apoptosis and a cell cycle arrest in G1 in the remaining non-apoptotic cells, these effects were much more pronounced with knockdown of p110beta. CONCLUSIONS Our results support the concept that p110beta appears to be the predominant functional class I PI 3-kinase isoform in prostate cancer cells.},

abstract = {A method to measure the degree of co-localization of objects in confocal dual-colour images has been developed. This image analysis produced two coefficients that represent the fraction of co-localizing objects in each component of a dual-channel image. The generation of test objects with a Gaussian intensity distribution, at well-defined positions in both components of dual-channel images, allowed an accurate investigation of the reliability of the procedure. To do that, the co-localization coefficients were determined before degrading the image with background, cross-talk and Poisson noise. These synthesized sources of image deterioration represent sources of deterioration that must be dealt with in practical confocal imaging, namely dark current, non-specific binding and cross-reactivity of fluorescent probes, optical cross-talk and photon noise. The degraded images were restored by filtering and cross-talk correction. The co-localization coefficients of the restored images were not significantly different from those of the original undegraded images. Finally, we tested the procedure on images of real biological specimens. The results of these tests correspond with data found in the literature. We conclude that the co-localization coefficients can provide relevant quantitative information about the positional relation between biological objects or processes.},

To better understand transcriptional regulatory mechanism driving heart development and the consequences of its disruption, we isolated cardiomyocytes (CMs) from wild-type zebrafish embryos at 24, 48 and 72 hours post fertilization corresponding to heart looping, chamber formation and heart maturation, and from mutant lines carrying loss-of-function mutations in gata5, tbx5a and hand2, transcription factors (TFs) required for proper heart development. The integration of CM transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and genome-wide chromatin accessibility maps (ATAC-seq) unravelled dynamic regulatory networks driving crucial events of heart development. These networks contained key cardiac TFs including Gata5/6, Nkx2.5, Tbx5/20, and Hand2, and are associated with open chromatin regions enriched for DNA sequence motifs belonging to the family of the corresponding TFs. These networks were disrupted in cardiac TF mutants, indicating their importance in proper heart development. The most prominent gene expression changes, which correlated with chromatin accessibility modifications within their proximal promoter regions, occurred between heart looping and chamber formation, and were associated with metabolic and hematopoietic/cardiac switch during CM maturation. Furthermore, loss of function of cardiac TFs Gata5, Tbx5a, and Hand2 affected the cardiac regulatory networks and caused global changes in chromatin accessibility profile. Among regions with differential chromatin accessibility in mutants were highly conserved non-coding elements which represent putative cis regulatory elements with potential role in heart development and disease. Altogether, our results revealed the dynamic regulatory landscape at key stages of heart development and identified molecular drivers of heart morphogenesis.},

abstract = {The interleukin (IL)-17/IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) complex has been shown to be important for the regulation of inflammation; however, its role in the regulation of tumor processes has recently emerged as a research focus. The present study demonstrated that oxaliplatin was able to increase the levels of IL-17/IL-17R in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and cells lines, and that it had important roles in reducing the susceptibility of the cells to oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the expression of autophagy-related proteins was induced by IL-17/IL-17R and autophagy was shown to induce resistance to oxaliplatin in HCC. In addition, the janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway was shown to be an important pathway in the induction of autophagy in response to oxaliplatin. Autopjhagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine and JAK2/STAT3 signaling was blocked by AG490, which induced apoptosis in SMMC7721 cells treated with oxaliplatin. The results of the present study may help to elucidate the mechanism underlying the role of IL-17/IL-17R-induced autophagy in the chemoresistance of HCC, as well as help to establish and develop measures to overcome chemoresistance in HCC.},

Despite the enormity of the obesity pandemic, there are currently only two FDA-approved therapies for its treatment and these drugs exhibit modest efficacy and have limiting side effects. Prieurianin is a plant limonoid product that deters feeding in insect larvae. We investigated in this study the effects of prieurianin on weight loss and adipogenesis. Our results showed that prieurianin causes weight loss by reducing energy intake in obese mice on high-calorie diet. We also found that prieurianin is anti-adipogenic in cultured preadipocytes and adipocytes by inhibiting proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes, and induces either dedifferentiation or delipidation of mature adipocytes. Whether prieurianin can potentially be used for obesity treatment in human warrants further investigation.},

Moreover, excess miR-378a-5p triggered receptor tyrosine kinase-MAP kinase pathway signalling, and was associated with suppression of Aurora B kinase. In breast cancer in vivo, we found that high miR-378a-5p levels correlate with the most aggressive, poorly differentiated forms of cancer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: Downregulation of Aurora B by excess miR-378a-5p can explain the observed microtubule drug resistance and increased chromosomal imbalance in the microRNA-overexpressing cells.

Changes in cell surface sialylation have recently been implicated in mediating EMT. Herein we report the visualization of dynamic changes of sialylation and glycoproteomic analysis of newly synthesized sialylated proteins in EMT by metabolic labeling of sialylated glycans with azides, followed by click labeling with fluorophores or affinity tags. We discovered that sialylation was down-regulated during EMT but then reverted and up-regulated in the mesenchymal state after EMT, accompanied by mRNA expression level changes of genes involved in the sialic acid biosynthesis. Quantitative proteomic analysis identified a list of sialylated proteins whose biosynthesis was dynamically regulated during EMT. Sialylation of cell surface adherent receptor integrin $\beta$4 was found to be down-regulated, which may regulate integrin functions during EMT. Furthermore, a global sialylation inhibitor was used to probe the functional role of sialylation during EMT. We found that inhibition of sialylation promoted EMT. Taken together, our findings suggest the important role of sialylation in regulating EMT and imply its possible function in related pathophysiological events, such as cancer metastasis.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy (autophagy hereafter) is an evolutionarily highly conserved catabolic process activated by eukaryotes in order to counteract cellular starvation. Autophagy leads to bulk degradation of cytoplasmic content in the lysosomal compartment, thereby clearing the cytoplasm and generating nutrients and energy. Upon autophagy initiation, cytoplasmic material becomes sequestered in newly formed double-membrane vesicles termed 'autophagosomes' that subsequently acquire acidic hydrolases for content destruction. The de novo biogenesis of autophagosomes often occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, in many cases, in close proximity to lipid droplets (LDs), intracellular neutral lipid storage reservoirs. LDs are targets of autophagic destruction, but have recently also been shown to contribute to autophagosome formation. In fact, some autophagy-related (Atg) proteins, such as microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), Atg2 and Atg14L, functionally contribute to both LD and autophagosome biogenesis. In the present paper, we discuss Atg proteins, including members of the human WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides (WIPI) family that co-localize prominently with LC3, Atg2 and Atg14L to conceivably integrate LD and autophagosome dynamics.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of the control and activity of the autophagy-lysosomal protein degradation machinery are emerging as an important theme for neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. However, the underlying regulatory and functional networks of known genes controlling autophagy and lysosomal function and their role in disease are relatively unexplored. We performed a systems biology-based integrative computational analysis to study the interactions between molecular components and to develop models for regulation and function of genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal function. Specifically, we analyzed transcriptional and microRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation of these genes and performed functional enrichment analyses to understand their involvement in nervous system-related diseases and phenotypes. Transcriptional regulatory network analysis showed that binding sites for transcription factors, SREBP1, USF, AP-1 and NFE2, are common among autophagy and lysosomal genes. MicroRNA enrichment analysis revealed miR-130, 98, 124, 204 and 142 as the putative post-transcriptional regulators of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway genes. Pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the mTOR and insulin signaling pathways are important in the regulation of genes involved in autophagy. In addition, we found that glycosaminoglycan and glycosphingolipid pathways also make a major contribution to lysosomal gene regulation. The analysis confirmed the known contribution of the autophagy-lysosomal genes to Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases and also revealed potential involvement in tuberous sclerosis, neuronal ceroidlipofuscinoses, sepsis and lung, liver and prostatic neoplasms. To further probe the impact of autophagy-lysosomal gene deficits on neurologically-linked phenotypes, we also mined the mouse knockout phenotype data for the autophagylysosomal genes and found them to be highly predictive of nervous system dysfunction. Overall this study demonstrates the utility of systems biology-based approaches for understanding the autophagy-lysosomal pathways and gaining additional insights into the potential impact of defects in these complex biological processes.},

abstract = {Cell migration, differentiation, proliferation, and morphology are vital processes in normal tissue development and morphogenesis of the human body and organ systems. Individual cell migration positions cells in tissues during morphogenesis and cancer, or allows them to pass through the tissue, as seen by immune cells. On the other hand, collective cell migration, such as neural crest, vasculature, and many epithelial cell migrations, is another fundamental form of cell translocation, which may relatively differ from individual cell migration while it is an important step in tissue generation. During cell migration, amoeboid movement causes frequent changes in cell shape due to the extension of protrusions in the cell front and retraction of cell rear. Regulation of intracellular mechanics and cell's physical interaction with its substrate relies on the control of cell shape during cell migration. Therefore, it is fundamental to understand this process in many biological processes ranging from morphogenesis to metastatic cancer cells. In addition to mechanical cue, cell migration can be also directed by chemical, thermal, and/or electrical stimuli. To achieve productive cell migration, each signaling passway may be temporally and spatially effective in particular regions of the cell substrate. Besides, experimental observations confirm that cells may undergo differentiation and/or proliferation due to mechanosensing process. In these concepts, numerical methods can effectively assist us to understand better the physical mechanism behind different aspects of cell behavior such as singular or collective cell migration, cell morphological changes, cell differentiation and proliferation. Therefore, through the present chapter, the main objective is to introduce a robust numerical model that considers different features of single and collective cell behavior in the presence of different stimuli in their microenvironment. Guided by experiential observations, the cell translocation is modeled by the equilibrium of effective forces on cell body such as traction, protrusion, electrostatic and drag forces, assuming that the cell traction forces are regulated by the cell internal deformations. To do so, the finite element discrete methodology is employed in which the cell is represented by a group of finite elements following two different strategies: a constant spherical cell shape and a free mood cell shape.},

abstract = {EBF1 plays a crucial role in early adipogenesis; however, despite high expression in mature adipocytes, its function in these cells is currently unknown. To identify direct and indirect EBF1 targets in fat, we undertook a combination of transcriptional profiling of EBF1-deficient adipocytes and genome-wide EBF1 location analysis. Our results indicate that many components of metabolic and inflammatory pathways are positively and directly regulated by EBF1, including PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and STAT1 signaling. Accordingly, we observed significant reduction of multiple signaling events in EBF1 knockdown cells as well as a reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipogenesis. Inflammatory signaling, gene expression, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were also significantly affected by loss of EBF1 in adipocytes, although ChIP-sequencing results suggest that these actions are indirect. We also found that EBF1 occupies some 35,000 sites in adipocytes, most of which occur in enhancers. Significantly, comparison with three other published EBF1 ChIP-sequencing data sets in B-cells reveals both gene- and cell type-specific patterns of EBF1 binding. These results advance our understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms regulating signaling pathways in mature fat cells and indicate that EBF1 functions as a key integrator of signal transduction, inflammation, and metabolism.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 UICC.We have previously reported that the negative signaling regulator Similar Expression to FGF (hSef) is downregulated in prostate cancer and its loss is associated with clinical metastasis. Here, we explored the mechanistic basis of this finding. We first confirmed our clinical observation by testing hSef manipulation in an in vivo metastasis model. hSef stable expressing cells (PC3M-hSef) or empty vector controls (PC3M-EV) were injected subcutaneously into the lateral thoracic walls of NOD-SCID gamma mice and lungs were harvested at autopsy. In this model, 6/7 PC3M-EV xenografts had definitive lung micro-metastasis whilst only 1/6 PC3M-hSef xenografts exhibited metastasis recapitulating the clinical scenario (p=0.03). Gene expression studies revealed key perturbations in genes involved in cell motility and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) along with alterations in cognate signaling pathways. These results were validated in an EMT specific PCR array whereby hSef over-expression and silencing reciprocally altered E-Cadherin expression (p={\textless}0.001) amongst other EMT markers. Immunohistochemistry of excised tumors from the xenografts also confirmed the effect of hSef in suppressing E-Cadherin expression at the protein level. Phosphokinase arrays further demonstrated a role for hSef in attenuating signaling of not only ERK-MAPK but also the JNK and p38 pathways as well. Taken together, these data suggest evidence that loss of hSef may be a critical event facilitating tumor dissemination of prostate cancer through alteration of EMT. Detection of downregulated hSef, along with other negative regulators, may therefore be a useful biomarker heralding a transition to a metastatic phenotype and warrants further exploration in this context.},

We have established several endocrine insensitive breast cancer lines by shRNA induced depletion of estrogen receptor (ER) by transfection of MCF-7 cells which all exhibit enhanced expression profile of mesenchymal markers with reduction of epithelial markers, indicating an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In this study we describe their behaviour in response to change in extracellular pH, an important factor controlling cell motility and metastasis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Morphological changes associated with cell exposure to extracellular alkaline pH were assessed by live cell microscopy and the effect of various ion pumps on this behavior was investigated by pretreatment with chemical inhibitors. The activity and expression profile of key signaling molecules was assessed by western blotting. Cell motility and invasion were examined by scratch and under-agarose assays respectively. Total matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and specifically of MMP2/9 was assessed in conditioned medium in response to brief alkaline pH exposure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Exposure of ER -ve but not ER +ve breast cancer cells to extracellular alkaline pH resulted in cell shrinkage and spherical appearance (termed contractolation); this was reversed by returning the pH back to 7.4. Contractolation was blocked by targeting the Na(+)/K(+) and Na(+)/H(+) pumps with specific chemical inhibitors. The activity and expression profile of key signaling molecules critical for cell adhesion were modulated by the exposure to alkaline pH. Brief exposure to alkaline pH enhanced MMP2/9 activity and the invasive potential of ER -ve cells in response to serum components and epithelial growth factor stimulation without affecting unhindered motility.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Endocrine resistant breast cancer cells behave very differently to estrogen responsive cells in alkaline pH, with enhanced invasive potential; these studies emphasise the crucial influence of extracellular pH and caution against indiscriminate application of alkalinising drug therapy.},

The reporter gene assay showed that the variant G allele of rs1076064 exerted higher promoter activity than the A allele.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that rs1076064 may be a biomarker for HCC susceptibility and prognosis through altering pri-miR-378 transcription.},

abstract = {The complex signaling dynamics of transcription factors can encode both qualitative and quantitative information about the extracellular environment, which increases the information transfer capacity and potentially supports accurate cellular decision-making. An important question is how these signaling dynamics patterns are translated into functionally appropriate gene regulation programs. To address this question for transcription factors of the nuclear factor $\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) family, we profiled the single-cell dynamics of two major NF-$\kappa$B subunits, RelA and c-Rel, induced by a panel of pathogen-derived stimuli in immune and nonimmune cellular contexts. Diverse NF-$\kappa$B-activating ligands produced different patterns of RelA and c-Rel signaling dynamic features, such as variations in duration or time-integrated activity. Analysis of nascent transcripts delineated putative direct targets of NF-$\kappa$B as compared to genes controlled by other transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms and showed that the transcription of more than half of the induced genes was tightly linked to specific dynamic features of NF-$\kappa$B signaling. Fibroblast and macrophage cell lines shared a cluster of such "NF-$\kappa$B dynamics-decoding" genes, as well as cell type-specific decoding genes. Dissecting the subunit specificity of dynamics-decoding genes suggested that target genes were most often linked to both RelA and c-Rel or to RelA alone. Thus, our analysis reveals the cell type-specific interpretation of pathogenic information through the signaling dynamics of NF-$\kappa$B.},

Whereas a number of chapters in this review are devoted to the role of low- dose environmental mixtures and carcinogens in the promotion of invasion and metastasis in specific tumors such as breast and prostate, the overarching theme is the role of low-dose carcinogens in the progression of cancer stem cells. It is becoming clearer that cancer stem cells in a tumor are the ones that assume invasive properties and colonize distant organs. Therefore,low-dose contaminants that trigger epithelial–mesenchymal transition, for example, in these cells are of particular interest in this review. This we hope will lead to the collaboration between scientists who have dedicated their professional life to the study of carcinogens and those whose interests are exclusively in the arena of tissue invasion and metastasis.},

abstract = {The acquisition of cell motility is an early step in melanoma metastasis. Here we use intravital imaging of signalling reporter cell-lines combined with genome-wide transcriptional analysis to define signalling pathways and genes associated with melanoma metastasis. Intravital imaging revealed heterogeneous cell behaviour in vivo: {\textless}10{\%} of cells were motile and both singly moving cells and streams of cells were observed. Motile melanoma cells had increased Notch- and SRF-dependent transcription. Subsequent genome-wide analysis identified an overlapping set of genes associated with high Notch and SRF activity. We identified EZH2, a histone methyltransferase in the Polycomb repressive complex 2, as a regulator of these genes. Heterogeneity of EZH2 levels is observed in melanoma models, and co-ordinated upregulation of genes positively regulated by EZH2 is associated with melanoma metastasis. EZH2 was also identified as regulating the amelanotic phenotype of motile cells in vivo by suppressing expression of the P-glycoprotein Oca2. Analysis of patient samples confirmed an inverse relationship between EZH2 levels and pigment. EZH2 targeting with siRNA and chemical inhibition reduced invasion in mouse and human melanoma cell lines. The EZH2-regulated genes KIF2C and KIF22 are required for melanoma cell invasion and important for lung colonization. We propose that heterogeneity in EZH2 levels leads to heterogeneous expression of a cohort of genes associated with motile behaviour including KIF2C and KIF22. EZH2-dependent increased expression of these genes promotes melanoma cell motility and early steps in metastasis.Oncogene advance online publication, 10 November 2014; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.362.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that dysregulated eIF3d expression may be critical in various genetic disorders as well as cancer. In this study, we observed that EIF3d levels increased in gallbladder cancer (GBC) samples compared with non-tumor tissue. High eIF3d levels were associated with advanced tumor stage and metastasis and were correlated with poor prognosis in 92 patients with GBC. Depletion of EIF3d in GBC cell lines inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and metastasis and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, ectopic expression of eIF3d had the opposite effects. Moreover, in this study, we revealed that a novel non-translational factor function of eIF3d mediated its protumoral effects. In details, eIF3d stabilizes GRK2 protein by blocking ubiquitin-mediated degradation, consequently activates PI3K/Akt signaling, and promotes GBC cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, eIF3d promotes GBC progression mainly via eIF3d-GRK2-AKT axis and it may be used as a prognostic factor. The therapeutic targeting of eIF3d-GRK2 axis may be a potential treatment approach for GBC.},

abstract = {Indole compounds, obtained from cruciferous vegetables, are well-known for their anti-cancer properties. In particular, indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its dimeric product, 3,3´-diindolylmethane (DIM), have been widely investigated for their effectiveness against a number of human cancers in vitro as well as in vivo. These compounds are effective inducers of apoptosis and the accumulating evidence documenting their ability to modulate multiple cellular signaling pathways is a testimony to their pleiotropic behavior. Here we attempt to update current understanding on the various mechanisms that are responsible for the apoptosis-inducing effects by these compounds. The significance of apoptosis-induction as a desirable attribute of anti-cancer agents such as indole compounds cannot be overstated. However, an equally intriguing property of these compounds is their ability to sensitize cancer cells to standard chemotherapeutic agents. Such chemosensitizing effects of indole compounds can potentially have major clinical implications because these non-toxic compounds can reduce the toxicity and drug-resistance associated with available chemotherapies. Combinational therapy is increasingly being realized to be better than single agent therapy and, through this review article, we aim to provide a rationale behind combination of natural compounds such as indoles with conventional therapeutics.},

Intracellular replication of several bacterial pathogens, including Legionella pneumophila, is restricted by the retrograde trafficking pathway. L. pneumophila employs the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system (T4SS) to form the replication-permissive Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), which is decorated with multiple components of the retrograde trafficking machinery as well as retrograde cargo receptors. The L. pneumophila effector protein RidL is secreted by the T4SS and interferes with retrograde trafficking. Here, we review recent evidence that the LCV interacts with the retrograde trafficking pathway, discuss the possible sites of action and function of RidL in the retrograde route, and put forth the hypothesis that the LCV is an acceptor compartment of retrograde transport vesicles.},

abstract = {Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding-protein (PEBP) family that modulates the action of many kinases involved in cellular growth, apoptosis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, motility, invasion and metastasis. Previously, we described an inverse association between RKIP and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression in gastric adenocarcinoma patients. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism by which RKIP regulates STAT3 activity in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. RKIP over expression inhibited c-Src auto-phosphorylation and activation, as well as IL-6-, JAK1 and 2-, and activated Raf-mediated STAT3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation and subsequent activation. In MDA-231 breast cancer cells that stably over express RKIP, IL-6 treatment blocked STAT3 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation. Conversely, in RKIP knockdown MDA-231 cells: STAT3 phosphorylation and activation increased in comparison to parental MDA-231 cells. RKIP over expression resulted in constitutive physical interaction with STAT3 and blocked c-Src and STAT3 association. The treatment of DU145 prostate, but not PC3 prostate or MDA-231 breast, cancer cell lines with ENMD-1198 or MKC-1 dramatically increased expression of RKIP. Overexpression of RKIP sensitized PC3 and MDA-231 cells to MTI-induced apoptosis. Moreover, MTI treatment resulted in a decrease in Src-mediated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation, an effect that was significantly enhanced by RKIP over expression. In stable RKIP over expressing MDA-231 cells, tumor xenograft growth induced by activated STAT3 is inhibited. RKIP synergizes with MTIs to induce apoptosis and inhibit STAT3 activation of breast and prostate cancer cells. RKIP plays a critical role in opposing the effects of pro-oncogenic STAT3 activation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Network methods are increasingly used to represent the interactions of genes and/or proteins. Genes or proteins that are directly linked may have a similar biological function or may be part of the same biological pathway. Since the information on the connection (adjacency) between 2 nodes may be noisy or incomplete, it can be desirable to consider alternative measures of pairwise interconnectedness. Here we study a class of measures that are proportional to the number of neighbors that a pair of nodes share in common. For example, the topological overlap measure by Ravasz et al. 1 can be interpreted as a measure of agreement between the m = 1 step neighborhoods of 2 nodes. Several studies have shown that two proteins having a higher topological overlap are more likely to belong to the same functional class than proteins having a lower topological overlap. Here we address the question whether a measure of topological overlap based on higher-order neighborhoods could give rise to a more robust and sensitive measure of interconnectedness. RESULTS: We generalize the topological overlap measure from m = 1 step neighborhoods to m {\textgreater} or = 2 step neighborhoods. This allows us to define the m-th order generalized topological overlap measure (GTOM) by (i) counting the number of m-step neighbors that a pair of nodes share and (ii) normalizing it to take a value between 0 and 1. Using theoretical arguments, a yeast co-expression network application, and a fly protein network application, we illustrate the usefulness of the proposed measure for module detection and gene neighborhood analysis. CONCLUSION: Topological overlap can serve as an important filter to counter the effects of spurious or missing connections between network nodes. The m-th order topological overlap measure allows one to trade-off sensitivity versus specificity when it comes to defining pairwise interconnectedness and network modules.},

The survival rates and lung fungal burdens were markedly improved by PICLC immunotherapy in animals infected with any one of the three {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Aspergillus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} species. While protection from IA was remarkable, PICLC induction of type I IFN in the lungs surged 24 h posttreatment and returned to baseline levels by 48 h, suggesting that PICLC altered early events in protection against IA. Immunophenotyping of recruited leukocytes and histopathological examination of tissue sections showed that PICLC induced similar cellular infiltrates as those in untreated-infected mice, in both cases dominated by monocytic cells and neutrophils. However, the PICLC immunotherapy resulted in a marked earlier recruitment of the leukocytes. Unlike with conidia, infection with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}A. nidulans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} germlings reduced the protective effect of PICLC immunotherapy. Additionally, antibody depletion of neutrophils totally reversed the protection, suggesting that neutrophils are crucial for PICLC-mediated protection. Together, these data show that prophylactic PICLC immunotherapy prerecruits these cells, enabling them to attack the conidia and thus resulting in a profound protection from IA. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Candida albicans hyphae can reach enormous lengths, precluding their internalization by phagocytes. Nevertheless, macrophages engulf a portion of the hypha, generating incompletely sealed tubular phagosomes. These frustrated phagosomes are stabilized by a thick cuff of F-actin that polymerizes in response to non-canonical activation of integrins by fungal glycan. Despite their continuity, the surface and invaginating phagosomal membranes retain a strikingly distinct lipid composition. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is present at the plasmalemma but is not detectable in the phagosomal membrane, while PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 co-exist in the phagosomes yet are absent from the surface membrane. Moreover, endo-lysosomal proteins are present only in the phagosomal membrane. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed the presence of a diffusion barrier that maintains the identity of the open tubular phagosome separate from the plasmalemma. Formation of this barrier depends on Syk, Pyk2/Fak and formin-dependent actin assembly. Antimicrobial mechanisms can thereby be deployed, limiting the growth of the hyphae.},

abstract = {The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), as members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, mediate eukaryotic cell responses to a wide range of abiotic and biotic stress insults. JNKs also regulate important physiological processes, including neuronal functions, immunological actions, and embryonic development, via their impact on gene expression, cytoskeletal protein dynamics, and cell death/survival pathways. Although the JNK pathway has been under study for {\textgreater}20 years, its complexity is still perplexing, with multiple protein partners of JNKs underlying the diversity of actions. Here we review the current knowledge of JNK structure and isoforms as well as the partnerships of JNKs with a range of intracellular proteins. Many of these proteins are direct substrates of the JNKs. We analyzed almost 100 of these target proteins in detail within a framework of their classification based on their regulation by JNKs. Examples of these JNK substrates include a diverse assortment of nuclear transcription factors (Jun, ATF2, Myc, Elk1), cytoplasmic proteins involved in cytoskeleton regulation (DCX, Tau, WDR62) or vesicular transport (JIP1, JIP3), cell membrane receptors (BMPR2), and mitochondrial proteins (Mcl1, Bim). In addition, because upstream signaling components impact JNK activity, we critically assessed the involvement of signaling scaffolds and the roles of feedback mechanisms in the JNK pathway. Despite a clarification of many regulatory events in JNK-dependent signaling during the past decade, many other structural and mechanistic insights are just beginning to be revealed. These advances open new opportunities to understand the role of JNK signaling in diverse physiological and pathophysiological states.},

abstract = {Protein tyrosine phosphorylation cascades are difficult to analyze and are critical for cell signaling in higher eukaryotes. Methodology for profiling tyrosine phosphorylation, considered herein as the assignment of multiple protein tyrosine phosphorylation sites in single analyses, was reported recently (Salomon, A. R.; Ficarro, S. B.; Brill, L. M.; Brinker, A.; Phung, Q. T.; Ericson, C.; Sauer, K.; Brock, A.; Horn, D. M.; Schultz, P. G.; Peters, E. C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003, 100, 443-448). The technology platform included the use of immunoprecipitation, immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), liquid chromatography, and tandem mass spectrometry. In the present report, we show that when using complex mixtures of peptides from human cells, methylation improved the selectivity of IMAC for phosphopeptides and eliminated the acidic bias that occurred with unmethylated peptides. The IMAC procedure was significantly improved by desalting methylated peptides, followed by gradient elution of the peptides to a larger IMAC column. These improvements resulted in assignment of approximately 3-fold more tyrosine phosphorylation sites, from human cell lysates, than the previous methodology. Nearly 70 tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides from proteins in human T cells were assigned in single analyses. These proteins had unknown functions or were associated with a plethora of fundamental cellular processes. This robust technology platform should be broadly applicable to profiling the dynamics of tyrosine phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Purpose of review Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is comprised of a heterogeneous group of disorders with highly variable natural histories and response to therapies. Pharmacogenetics focuses on the variability in drug response because of the presence of genetic factors that influence drug metabolism or disease activity. In this article, we review relevant drug-specific and disease-specific polymorphisms that may influence therapeutic response, and then highlight a recently identified drug–gene interaction in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Recent findings The emergence of high-throughput genomic technology has allowed for identification of gene polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to specific disease states, including IPF and several connective tissue diseases known to cause ILD. IPF risk loci span a diverse group of genes, while most associated with connective tissue disease are critical to immune signaling. A recent pharmacogenetic analysis of patients enrolled in an IPF clinical trial identified a variant within TOLLIP to be associated with differential response to N-acetylcysteine therapy. Summary Though few pharmacogenetic investigations have been conducted in patients with ILD to date, ample opportunities for pharmacogenetic exploration exist in this patient population. Such exploration will advance our understanding of specific ILDs and help usher in an era of personalized medicine.},

abstract = {Activation of the PI3K pathway occurs commonly in a wide variety of cancers. Experience with other successful targeted agents suggests that clinical resistance is likely to arise and may reduce the durability of clinical benefit. Here, we sought to understand mechanisms underlying resistance to PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deficient cancers. We generated cell lines resistant to the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 from parental PTEN-null breast cancer cell lines and identified a novel PIK3CB D1067Y mutation in both cell lines that was recurrent in cancer patients. Stable expression of mutant PIK3CB variants conferred resistance to PI3K inhibition that could be overcome by downstream AKT or mTORC1/2 inhibitors. Furthermore, we show that the p110beta D1067Y mutant was highly activated and induced PIP3 levels at the cell membrane, subsequently promoting the localization and activation of AKT and PDK1 at the membrane and driving PI3K signaling to a level that could withstand treatment with proximal inhibitors. Finally, we demonstrate that the PIK3CB D1067Y mutant behaved as an oncogene and transformed normal cells, an activity that was enhanced by PTEN depletion. Collectively, these novel preclinical and clinical findings implicate the acquisition of activating PIK3CB D1067 mutations as an important event underlying the resistance of cancer cells to selective PI3K inhibitors.

abstract = {Large-scale sequencing of cDNAs randomly picked from libraries has proven to be a very powerful approach to discover (putatively) expressed sequences that, in turn, once mapped, may greatly expedite the process involved in the identification and cloning of human disease genes. However, the integrity of the data and the pace at which novel sequences can be identified depends to a great extent on the cDNA libraries that are used. Because altogether, in a typical cell, the mRNAs of the prevalent and intermediate frequency classes comprise as much as 50-65{\%} of the total mRNA mass, but represent no more than 1000-2000 different mRNAs, redundant identification of mRNAs of these two frequency classes is destined to become overwhelming relatively early in any such random gene discovery programs, thus seriously compromising their cost-effectiveness. With the goal of facilitating such efforts, previously we developed a method to construct directionally cloned normalized cDNA libraries and applied it to generate infant brain (INIB) and fetal liver/spleen (INFLS) libraries, from which a total of 45,192 and 86,088 expressed sequence tags, respectively, have been derived. While improving the representation of the longest cDNAs in our libraries, we developed three additional methods to normalize cDNA libraries and generated over 35 libraries, most of which have been contributed to our integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and Their Expression (IMAGE) Consortium and thus distributed widely and used for sequencing and mapping. In an attempt to facilitate the process of gene discovery further, we have also developed a subtractive hybridization approach designed specifically to eliminate (or reduce significantly the representation of) large pools of arrayed and (mostly) sequenced clones from normalized libraries yet to be (or just partly) surveyed. Here we present a detailed description and a comparative analysis of four methods that we developed and used to generate normalize cDNA libraries from human (15), mouse (3), rat (2), as well as the parasite Schistosoma mansoni (1). In addition, we describe the construction and preliminary characterization of a subtracted liver/spleen library (INFLS-SI) that resulted from the elimination (or reduction of representation) of -5000 INFLS-IMAGE clones from the INFLS library.},

Recent studies have indicated the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (RANK) in various solid tumors, including breast cancer. Although activation of the RANK ligand (RANKL)/RANK system promotes cell migration, metastasis, and anchorage-independent growth of tumor-initiating cells, it remains to be investigated if RANKL induces EMT in breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigated whether RANKL induces EMT in normal breast mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells, and the mechanism underlying such induction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Expression levels of vimentin, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Snail, Slug, and Twist were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell migration and invasion were assessed using Boyden chamber and invasion assays, respectively. The effects of RANKL on signal transduction molecules were determined by western blot analyses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that stimulation by RANKL altered the cell morphology to the mesenchymal phenotype in normal breast epithelial and breast cancer cells. In addition, RANKL increased the expression levels of vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail, and Twist and decreased the expression of E-cadherin. We also found that RANKL activated nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Moreover, dimethyl fumarate, a NF-$\kappa$B inhibitor, inhibited RANKL-induced EMT, cell migration, and invasion, and upregulated the expressions of Snail, Twist, vimentin, and N-cadherin.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that RANKL induces EMT by activating the NF-$\kappa$B pathway and enhancing Snail and Twist expression. These findings suggest that the RANKL/RANK system promotes tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis via the induction of EMT.},

abstract = {The $\gamma$ subunits of heterotrimeric AMPK complexes contain the binding sites for the regulatory adenine nucleotides AMP, ADP and ATP. We addressed whether complexes containing different $\gamma$ isoforms display different responses to adenine nucleotides by generating cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged versions of the $\gamma$1, $\gamma$2 or $\gamma$3 isoform. When assayed at a physiological ATP concentration (5 mM), $\gamma$1- and $\gamma$2-containing complexes were allosterically activated almost 10-fold by AMP, with EC50 values one to two orders of magnitude lower than the ATP concentration. By contrast, $\gamma$3 complexes were barely activated by AMP under these conditions, although we did observe some activation at lower ATP concentrations. Despite this, all three complexes were activated, due to increased Thr(172) phosphorylation, when cells were incubated with mitochondrial inhibitors that increase cellular AMP. With $\gamma$1 complexes, activation and Thr(172) phosphorylation induced by the upstream kinase LKB1 [liver kinase B1; but not calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK$\beta$)] in cell-free assays was markedly promoted by AMP and, to a smaller extent and less potently, by ADP. However, effects of AMP or ADP on activation and phosphorylation of the $\gamma$2 and $\gamma$3 complexes were small or insignificant. Binding of AMP or ADP protected all three $\gamma$ subunit complexes against inactivation by Thr(172) dephosphorylation; with $\gamma$2 complexes, ADP had similar potency to AMP, but with $\gamma$1 and $\gamma$3 complexes, ADP was less potent than AMP. Thus, AMPK complexes containing different $\gamma$ subunit isoforms respond differently to changes in AMP, ADP or ATP. These differences may tune the responses of the isoforms to fit their differing physiological roles.},

abstract = {Noncoding regulatory variants play a central role in the genetics of human diseases and in evolution. Here we measure allele-specific transcription factor binding occupancy of three liver-specific transcription factors between crosses of two inbred mouse strains to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying transcription factor binding variations in mammals. Our results highlight the pre-eminence of cis-Acting variants on transcription factor occupancy divergence. Transcription factor binding differences linked to cis-Acting variants generally exhibit additive inheritance, while those linked to trans-Acting variants are most often dominantly inherited. Cis-Acting variants lead to local coordination of transcription factor occupancies that decay with distance; distal coordination is also observed and may be modulated by long-range chromatin contacts. Our results reveal the regulatory mechanisms that interplay to drive transcription factor occupancy, chromatin state, and gene expression in complex mammalian cell states.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) degrades various intracellular constituents to regulate a wide range of cellular functions, and is also closely linked to several human diseases. In selective autophagy, receptor proteins recognize degradation targets and direct their sequestration by double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which transport them into lysosomes or vacuoles. Although recent studies have shown that selective autophagy is involved in quality/quantity control of some organelles, including mitochondria and peroxisomes, it remains unclear how extensively it contributes to cellular organelle homeostasis. Here we describe selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nucleus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identify two novel proteins, Atg39 and Atg40, as receptors specific to these pathways. Atg39 localizes to the perinuclear ER (or the nuclear envelope) and induces autophagic sequestration of part of the nucleus. Atg40 is enriched in the cortical and cytoplasmic ER, and loads these ER subdomains into autophagosomes. Atg39-dependent autophagy of the perinuclear ER/nucleus is required for cell survival under nitrogen-deprivation conditions. Atg40 is probably the functional counterpart of FAM134B, an autophagy receptor for the ER in mammals that has been implicated in sensory neuropathy. Our results provide fundamental insight into the pathophysiological roles and mechanisms of 'ER-phagy' and 'nucleophagy' in other organisms.},

abstract = {TLC of total cellular lipids showed that 3T3-L1 cells predominantly accumulate triglycerides. GH and insulin principally regulated glucose utilization for synthesis of the fatty acid portion of 3T3-L1 triglycerides, with little effect on glucose utilization for synthesis of other lipids or triglyceride glycerol. Gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (MS) showed that 50{\%} of 3T3-L1 triglyceride fatty acids are 16-carbon chains. However, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were unusual, in that 20{\%} of their triglyceride fatty acids were C15 or C17 in length, observed by both MS of saponified triglycerides and electrospray MS of intact triglycerides. Gas chromatographic analysis of 14C-labeled fatty acids showed 3T3-L1 utilization of [14C]glucose for synthesis of C15 and C16 fatty acids. Insulin and GH regulated the amount of [14C]glucose incorporation into C15 and C16 fatty acids without altering their relative ratio. GH antagonized all studied insulin-regulated events. GH antagonism of insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 glucose transport, glucose oxidation, and glucose utilization for lipid synthesis reached a plateau of 50-60{\%} inhibition at 0.1-0.2 nM. Insulin, at 0.1 nM, suppressed 3T3-L1 generation of glycerol from lipolysis by approximately 50{\%}. GH, between 0.04-1.0 nM, fully reversed the insulin-inhibited lipolysis, although GH did not stimulate lipolysis beyond that in untreated control cultures. The results suggest that GH regulates a very early event in the insulin signal transduction pathway, such that is affects all insulin-responsive processes to essentially the same extent.},

This new technology, ChIP-Seq, presents opportunities for in-depth analysis of transcription regulation. In this study, we explore the value of using ChIP-Seq data to better detect and refine transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). We introduce a novel computational algorithm named Hybrid Motif Sampler (HMS), specifically designed for TFBS motif discovery in ChIP-Seq data. We propose a Bayesian model that incorporates sequencing depth information to aid motif identification. Our model also allows intra-motif dependency to describe more accurately the underlying motif pattern. Our algorithm combines stochastic sampling and deterministic 'greedy' search steps into a novel hybrid iterative scheme. This combination accelerates the computation process. Simulation studies demonstrate favorable performance of HMS compared to other existing methods. When applying HMS to real ChIP-Seq datasets, we find that (i) the accuracy of existing TFBS motif patterns can be significantly improved; and (ii) there is significant intra-motif dependency inside all the TFBS motifs we tested; modeling these dependencies further improves the accuracy of these TFBS motif patterns. These findings may offer new biological insights into the mechanisms of transcription factor regulation.},

However, the detailed molecular organization of transcription factors at hotspot regions is poorly defined. Here, we have used digital genomic footprinting to precisely define factor localization at a genome-wide level during the early phase of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, which allows us to obtain detailed molecular insight into how transcription factors target hotspots. We demonstrate the formation of ATF-C/EBP heterodimers at a composite motif on chromatin, and we suggest that this may be a general mechanism for integrating external signals on chromatin. Furthermore, we find evidence of extensive recruitment of transcription factors to hotspots through alternative mechanisms not involving their known motifs and demonstrate that these alternative binding events are functionally important for hotspot formation and activity. Taken together, these findings provide a framework for understanding transcription factor cooperativity in hotspots. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Microarray profiling revealed that in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 and C3H/10T1/2 adipocytes treated with RSG or DMSO vehicle for 1, 2, 4, 7, 24, and 48 hrs, RSG overwhelmingly increased mitochondrial gene transcripts time dependently. The timing of the increases was consistent with the cascade of organelle biogenesis, that is, initiated by induction of transcription factor(s), followed by increases in the biosynthesis machinery, and then by increases in functional components. The transcriptional increases were further validated by increased mitochondrial staining, citrate synthase activity, and O(2) consumption, and were found to be associated with increased adiponectin secretion. The work provided further insight on the mechanism of PPAR$\gamma$-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in differentiated adipocytes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intracellular signal transduction is achieved by networks of proteins and small molecules that transmit information from the cell surface to the nucleus, where they ultimately effect transcriptional changes. Understanding the mechanisms cells use to accomplish this important process requires a detailed molecular description of the networks involved. RESULTS: We have developed a computational approach for generating static models of signal transduction networks which utilizes protein-interaction maps generated from large-scale two-hybrid screens and expression profiles from DNA microarrays. Networks are determined entirely by integrating protein-protein interaction data with microarray expression data, without prior knowledge of any pathway intermediates. In effect, this is equivalent to extracting subnetworks of the protein interaction dataset whose members have the most correlated expression profiles. CONCLUSION: We show that our technique accurately reconstructs MAP Kinase signaling networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This approach should enhance our ability to model signaling networks and to discover new components of known networks. More generally, it provides a method for synthesizing molecular data, either individual transcript abundance measurements or pairwise protein interactions, into higher level structures, such as pathways and networks.},

Over past decades, NO has emerged as a molecule of interest in carcinogenesis and tumor growth progression. However, there is considerable controversy and confusion in understanding its role in cancer biology. It is said to have both tumoricidal as well as tumor promoting effects which depend on its timing, location, and concentration. NO has been suggested to modulate different cancer-related events including angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle, invasion, and metastasis. On the other hand, it is also emerging as a potential anti-oncogenic agent. Strategies for manipulating in vivo production and exogenous delivery of this molecule for therapeutic gain are being investigated. However, further validation and experimental/clinical trials are required for development of novel strategies based on NO for cancer treatment and prevention. This review discusses the range of actions of NO in cancer by performing an online MEDLINE search using relevant search terms and a review of the literature. Various mechanisms by which NO acts in different cancers such as breast, cervical, gastric,colorectal, and head and neck cancers are addressed. It also offers an insight into the dichotomous nature of NO and discusses its novel therapeutic applications for cancer prevention and treatment.},

TOR forms 2 structurally and functionally distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, and negatively regulates autophagy via TORC1. Here we demonstrate TOR also operates independently through the TORC2 signaling pathway to promote autophagy upon amino acid limitation. Under these conditions, TORC2, through its downstream target kinase Ypk1, inhibits the Ca2+ and Cmd1/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, to enable the activation of the amino acid-sensing EIF2S1/eIF2$\alpha$ kinase, Gcn2, and promote autophagy. Thus TORC2 signaling regulates autophagy in a pathway distinct from TORC1 to provide a tunable response to the cellular metabolic state.},

abstract = {In many applications, one is interested in determining which of the properties of a network module change across conditions. For example, to validate the existence of a module, it is desirable to show that it is reproducible (or preserved) in an independent test network. Here we study several types of network preservation statistics that do not require a module assignment in the test network. We distinguish network preservation statistics by the type of the underlying network. Some preservation statistics are defined for a general network (defined by an adjacency matrix) while others are only defined for a correlation network (constructed on the basis of pairwise correlations between numeric variables). Our applications show that the correlation structure facilitates the definition of particularly powerful module preservation statistics. We illustrate that evaluating module preservation is in general different from evaluating cluster preservation. We find that it is advantageous to aggregate multiple preservation statistics into summary preservation statistics. We illustrate the use of these methods in six gene co-expression network applications including 1) preservation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in mouse tissues, 2) comparison of human and chimpanzee brain networks, 3) preservation of selected KEGG pathways between human and chimpanzee brain networks, 4) sex differences in human cortical networks, 5) sex differences in mouse liver networks. While we find no evidence for sex specific modules in human cortical networks, we find that several human cortical modules are less preserved in chimpanzees. In particular, apoptosis genes are differentially co-expressed between humans and chimpanzees. Our simulation studies and applications show that module preservation statistics are useful for studying differences between the modular structure of networks.

abstract = {Insulin resistance is a heterogeneous disorder caused by a range of genetic and environmental factors, and we hypothesize that its etiology varies considerably between individuals. This heterogeneity provides significant challenges to the development of effective therapeutic regimes for long-term management of type 2 diabetes. We describe a novel strategy, using large-scale gene expression profiling, to develop a gene expression signature (GES) that reflects the overall state of insulin resistance in cells and patients. The GES was developed from 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were made "insulin resistant" by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) and then reversed with aspirin and troglitazone ("resensitized"). The GES consisted of five genes whose expression levels best discriminated between the insulin-resistant and insulin-resensitized states. We then used this GES to screen a compound library for agents that affected the GES genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a way that most closely resembled the changes seen when insulin resistance was successfully reversed with aspirin and troglitazone. This screen identified both known and new insulin-sensitizing compounds including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, $\beta$-adrenergic antagonists, $\beta$-lactams, and sodium channel blockers. We tested the biological relevance of this GES in participants in the San Antonio Family Heart Study (n = 1,240) and showed that patients with the lowest GES scores were more insulin resistant (according to HOMA{\_}IR and fasting plasma insulin levels; P {\textless} 0.001). These findings show that GES technology can be used for both the discovery of insulin-sensitizing compounds and the characterization of patients into subtypes of insulin resistance according to GES scores, opening the possibility of developing a personalized medicine approach to type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Metastastic breast cancer, especially triple-negative (TN), is one of the most common causes of cancer related deaths in women. Recent years, tumor-associate vessel formation is considered as a more generally and effective target to patient with malignant cancer. Our previous studies indicated that miR-19b-1 controls the intrinsic angiogenic activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. In this study, in silico analysis indicated VEZF1 that implicates in angiogenesis and triple-negative breast cancer progression might be the target of miR-19b-1. Further investigation showed that overexpressing miR-19b-1 in human triple-negative breast cancer cell line(MDA-MB-231) led to impaired angiogenic activity of HUVECs in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, miR-19b-1 upregulation inhibited the vessel imitation mediated by MDA-MB-231. Furthermore, enforced expression of miR-19b-1 in MDA-MB-231 has impact on HUVECs apoptosis and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential, which suggested the possible mechanism involved in interaction between breast cancer and endothelial cells. What's more, we found that miR-19b-1 stable overexpression in MDA-MB-231 caused tumor growth arresting entirely. Besides, our results suggested that miR-19b-1 could inhibit angiogenesis by possibly targeting VEGF receptor endocytosis signaling pathway. Taking together, our findings suggest an important role of miR-19b-1 in crosstalk between metastatic breast cancer and endothelial cells and provide us new insights for exploring miR-19b-1 and its multiple targets as promising therapeutic candidates to interfere breast cancer progression.},

abstract = {Dysregulated signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways is often the result of genetic alterations in critical components in these pathways or upstream activators. Unrestricted cellular proliferation and decreased sensitivity to apoptotic-inducing agents are typically associated with activation of these pro-survival pathways. This review discusses the functions these pathways have in normal and neoplastic tissue growth and how they contribute to resistance to apoptotic stimuli. Crosstalk and commonly identified mutations that occur within these pathways that contribute to abnormal activation and cancer growth will also be addressed. Finally the recently described roles of these pathways in cancer stem cells, cellular senescence and aging will be evaluated. Controlling the expression of these pathways could ameliorate human health.},

abstract = {The current study examined the role of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastasis. A total of 100 patients with NSCLC were recruited following pathological diagnosis in the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College. The patients were classified and statistically analyzed according to their clinicopathological characteristics and tumor-node-metastasis stage. Paired tumor tissue and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples were subject to pathological diagnosis and western blot analysis. Transient transfection and lentivirus particle vector-mediated RKIP overexpression, small interfering RNA-mediated silencing, Transwell assays and immunocytochemistry methods were employed to elucidate the role and underlying mechanisms of RKIP and the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway in NSCLC metastasis. Furthermore, in order to examine the in vivo effects of RKIP, recombinant lentivirus particles containing the RKIP gene were administrated in a mouse NSCLC tumor model via tail vein injection. The results revealed reduced RKIP expression levels in NSCLC tissue compared with corresponding non-cancer tissue. Additionally, RKIP expression levels were inversely associated with NSCLC intra-lung, lymph node and long-distance metastasis. The results also indicated that RKIP was able to block STAT3 activation via phosphorylation and inhibit NSCLC-cell metastasis in vitro. Furthermore, RKIP knockdown was able to promote STAT3 phosphorylation and cell metastasis in NSCLC cell lines. During in vivo experiments, RKIP overexpression was able to suppress xenograft tumor metastasis in nude mice. Therefore, RKIP may be an important factor in cancer cell metastasis in patients with NSCLC, and RKIP may inhibit NSCLC-cell invasion by blocking the activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as a new class of regulatory molecules that influence many biological functions, including metabolism, adipocyte differentiation. To determine the role of adipogenic miRNAs in the adipocyte differentiation process, we used microarray technology to monitor miRNA levels in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs-Ad), human stromal vascular cells (SVCs) and differentiated adipocytes. 79 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed, most of which are located in obesity related chromosomal regions but have not been previously linked to adipocyte differentiation process. A systematic search was made for relevant studies in academic data bases, involving the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) ArrayExpress, Pubmed and Embase database. Eight studies on human adipocyte differentiation or obesity were included in the final analysis. After combining our microarray data with meta-analysis of published microarray data, we detected 42 differently expressed miRNAs (meta-signature miRNAs) in mature adipocytes compared to SVCs or hMSCs-Ad. Our study shows meta-signature miRNAs specific for adipogenesis, several of which are correlated with key gene targets demonstrating functional relationships to pathways in BMP signaling pathway, Cell differentiation, Wnt signaling, insulin receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling, Cell cycle and lipid metabolic process. Our study shows that the first evidence of hsa-let-7 family, hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-27a-3p, hsa-miR-106b-5p, hsa-miR-148a-3p and hsa-miR-26b-5p got a great weight in adipogenesis. We concluded that meta-signature miRNAs involved in adipocyte differentiation and provided pathophysiological roles and novel insight into obesity and its related metabolic diseases.},

PCR ground fluorescence phase, non-exponential and plateau phase were excluded from the calculation process by separate mathematical algorithms. We validated the method on experimental data on multiple targets obtained on the LightCycler platform. The developed method yields results of higher accuracy than the currently used method of serial dilutions for amplification efficiency estimation. The single reaction set-up estimation is sensitive to differences in starting concentrations of the target sequence in samples. Furthermore, it resists the subjective influence of researchers, and the estimation can therefore be fully instrumentalized.},

NF-$\kappa$B is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this study, we treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with TGF-$\beta$ to induce EMT and cancer stem-like features and studied whether DSF can reverse this process. We found that DSF inhibited TGF-$\beta$ induced EMT in breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Also, DSF inhibited EMT-associated stem-like features, migration and invasion of tumor cells as well as tumor growth in xenograft model. The activation of NF-$\kappa$B was linked with EMT and stem-like cells. We conclude that DSF can suppress NF-$\kappa$B activity and downregulate ERK/NF-$\kappa$B/Snail pathway, leading to reverse EMT and stem-like features.

Toll-like receptor 2 and toll-interacting protein polymorphism influence the immune response after open heart surgery. This study aimed to assess the genetic distribution of toll-like receptor 2 N199N and toll-interacting protein rs5743867 polymorphism in the development of postoperative sepsis. METHODS A prospective cohort study was conducted in 108 children {\textless}1-year old who underwent open heart surgery with a Basic Aristotle score ≥6. Patients with an accompanying congenital anomaly, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or history of previous open heart surgery were excluded. The patients' nutritional status and genetic polymorphism were assessed prior to surgery. The results of genetic polymorphism were obtained through genotyping. Patients' ages on the day of surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass times were recorded. The diagnosis of sepsis was established according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign criteria. RESULTS Postoperative sepsis was observed in 21{\%} of patients. There were 92.6{\%} patients with toll-like receptor 2 N199N polymorphism and 52.8{\%} with toll-interacting protein rs5743867 polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS Toll-like receptor 2 N199N polymorphism tends to increase the risk of sepsis (odds ratio = 1.974; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.23-16.92; p = 0.504), while toll-interacting protein rs5743867 polymorphism tends to decrease the risk of sepsis (odds ratio = 0.496; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.19-1.27; p = 0.139) in infants {\textless}1-year old undergoing complex open heart surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orlistat has been shown to increase adiponectin and reduce progression to type 2 diabetes in obese Caucasians. Some effects of orlistat are thought to be independent of weight loss by altering gut flora and the production of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We studied the effect of dietary treatment with and without orlistat in South Asian individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) on adiponectin and inflammatory markers including LPS. METHODS: South Asian individuals were randomised to either dietary treatment with orlistat or dietary treatment alone. At the end of 12 months, a comparison was made between the two groups for differences in anthropomorphic measurements and serum markers. RESULTS: Three hundred and five individuals underwent oral glucose tolerance test of whom 40 had IGT. Complete baseline and 1-year data was available for 31 patients. After 1 year, patients in the orlistat group demonstrated a greater but insignificant decrease in weight (4.5 +/- 0.1 kg), and a significant increase in adiponectin (6.73 +/- 3.2 microg/ml) and decrease in LPS (4.55 +/- 1.98 EU/ml) compared with- the diet-alone group. In the orlistat group the reduction in LPS was correlated with the increase in adiponectin (p {\textless} 0.005). CONCLUSION: The increase in adiponectin levels in the orlistat group would suggest that orlistat may reduce the progression to type 2 diabetes in South Asian individuals by raising serum adiponectin. The finding that LPS levels are also reduced by orlistat and that this reduction correlates with the increase in adiponectin raises the possibility that the increase in adiponectin may be mediated via an effect on LPS levels.},

Components of tissue microenvironments are recognized to profoundly influence cellular phenotypes, including susceptibilities to toxic insults. Using a genome-wide analysis of transcriptional responses to genotoxic stress induced by cancer therapeutics, we identified a spectrum of secreted proteins derived from the tumor microenvironment that includes the Wnt family member wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 16B (WNT16B). We determined that WNT16B expression is regulated by nuclear factor of $\kappa$ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 1 (NF-$\kappa$B) after DNA damage and subsequently signals in a paracrine manner to activate the canonical Wnt program in tumor cells. The expression of WNT16B in the prostate tumor microenvironment attenuated the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy in vivo, promoting tumor cell survival and disease progression. These results delineate a mechanism by which genotoxic therapies given in a cyclical manner can enhance subsequent treatment resistance through cell nonautonomous effects that are contributed by the tumor microenvironment.},

abstract = {Members of the WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides (WIPI) family are phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) effectors that are essential for the formation of autophagosomes. Autophagosomes, unique double-membraned organelles, are characteristic for autophagy, a bulk degradation mechanism with cytoprotective and homeostatic function. Both, WIPI-1 and WIPI-2 are aberrantly expressed in several solid tumors, linking these genes to carcinogenesis. We now found that the expression of WIPI-1 was significantly reduced in a large cohort of 98 primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples (complex karyotypes; t(8;21); t(15,17); inv(16)). In contrast, the expression of WIPI-2 was only reduced in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a distinct subtype of AML (t(15,17)). As AML cells are blocked in their differentiation, we tested if the expression levels of WIPI-1 and WIPI-2 increase during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced neutrophil differentiation of APL. According to the higher WIPI-1 expression in granulocytes compared with immature blast cells, WIPI-1 but not WIPI-2 expression was significantly induced during neutrophil differentiation of NB4 APL cells. Interestingly, the induction of WIPI-1 expression was dependent on the transcription factor PU.1, a master regulator of myelopoiesis, supporting our notion that WIPI-1 expression is reduced in AML patients lacking proper PU-1 activity. Further, knocking down WIPI-1 in NB4 cells markedly attenuated the autophagic flux and significantly reduced neutrophil differentiation. This result was also achieved by knocking down WIPI-2, suggesting that both WIPI-1 and WIPI-2 are functionally required and not redundant in mediating the PI3P signal at the onset of autophagy in NB4 cells. In line with these data, downregulation of PI3KC3 (hVPS34), which generates PI3P upstream of WIPIs, also inhibited neutrophil differentiation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that both WIPI-1 and WIPI-2 are required for the PI3P-dependent autophagic activity during neutrophil differentiation, and that PU.1-dependent WIPI-1 expression is significantly repressed in primary AML patient samples and that the induction of autophagic flux is associated with neutrophil differentiation of APL cells.},

Thus, the proteasome regulates either directly or indirectly many important cellular processes. Altered regulation of these cellular events is linked to the development of cancer. Therefore, the proteasome has become an attractive target for the treatment of numerous cancers. Several proteasome inhibitors that target the proteolytic active sites of the 26S proteasome complex have been developed and tested for anti-tumor activities. These proteasome inhibitors have displayed impressive anti-tumor functions by inducing apoptosis in different tumor types. Further, the proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, and inhibit angiogenesis, cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, immune and inflammatory responses, and DNA repair response. A number of proteasome inhibitors are now in clinical trials to treat multiple myeloma and solid tumors. Many other proteasome inhibitors with different efficiencies are being developed and tested for anti-tumor activities. Several proteasome inhibitors currently in clinical trials have shown significantly improved anti-tumor activities when combined with other drugs such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, Akt (protein kinase B) inhibitors, DNA damaging agents, Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibitors, and lenalidomide.

abstract = {AIM Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is characterized by the acquisition of invasive fibroblast-like morphology by epithelial cells that are highly polarized. EMT is recognized as a crucial mechanism in cancer progression and metastasis. Here we sought to assess the involvement of Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (MnSOD) during the switch between epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like phenotypes in breast carcinoma. RESULTS Analysis of breast carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed strong positive correlation between tumors' EMT score and the expression of MnSOD. This positive correlation between MnSOD and EMT score was significant and consistent across all breast cancer subtypes. Similarly, a positive correlation of EMT score and MnSOD expression was observed in established cell lines derived from breast cancers exhibiting phenotypes ranging from the most epithelial to the most mesenchymal. Interestingly, using phenotypically distinct breast cancer cell lines, we provide evidence that constitutively high or induced expression of MnSOD promotes the EMT-like phenotype by way of a redox milieu predominantly driven by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Conversely, gene knockdown of MnSOD results in the reversal of EMT to a MET-like program, which appears to be a function of superoxide (O2-.)-directed signaling. INNOVATION AND CONCLUSION These data underscore the involvement of MnSOD in regulating the switch between the EMT and MET-associated phenotype by influencing cellular redox environment via its effect on the intracellular ratio between O2-. and H2O2. Strategies to manipulate MnSOD expression and/or the cellular redox milieu vis a vis O2-.:H2O2 could have potential therapeutic implications.},

abstract = {The gene encoding for transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the strongest type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) candidate gene discovered to date. The TCF7L2 protein is a key transcriptional effector of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway, which is an important developmental pathway that negatively regulates adipogenesis. However, the precise role that TCF7L2 plays in the development and function of adipocytes remains largely unknown. Using a combination of in vitro approaches, we first show that TCF7L2 protein is increased during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and primary adipocyte stem cells and that TCF7L2 expression is required for the regulation of Wnt signaling during adipogenesis. Inactivation of TCF7L2 protein by removing the high-mobility group (HMG)-box DNA binding domain in mature adipocytes in vivo leads to whole-body glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance. This phenotype is associated with increased subcutaneous adipose tissue mass, adipocyte hypertrophy, and inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that TCF7L2 mRNA expression is downregulated in humans with impaired glucose tolerance and adipocyte insulin resistance, highlighting the translational potential of these findings. In summary, our data indicate that TCF7L2 has key roles in adipose tissue development and function that may reveal, at least in part, how TCF7L2 contributes to the pathophysiology of T2DM.},

abstract = {MicroRNA miR-378 plays important roles in tumorigenesis by enhancing cell survival, reducing apoptosis, promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis and promoting cell migration and invasion. Abnormal expression of miR-378 has been observed in various types of cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression status of miR-378 and its clinical significance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using real-time quantitative PCR. miR-378 overexpression was identified in 26 of 84 (31{\%}) AML patients. The patients with miR-378 overexpression had lower hemoglobin level than those without miR-378 overexpression (66 versus 78. g/L, respectively, P=. 0.010). The frequency of miR-378 overexpression in FAB-M2 subtype was higher than other subtypes (44{\%} versus 20{\%}, P=. 0.032). Moreover, the frequency of miR-378 overexpression was higher in patients with t(8;21) than in others (64{\%} versus 24{\%}, P=. 0.012). The status of miR-378 expression was not correlated with the mutations of eight genes (FLT3-ITD, NPM1, C-KIT, IDH1/IDH2, DNMT3A, C/EBPA and U2AF1). The difference in relapse-free survival was observed between patients with and without miR-378 overexpression (. P=. 0.049). These findings suggest that miR-378 up-regulation is a common event and might have an adverse impact on prognosis in AML. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Endosomal sorting is a highly orchestrated cellular process. Retromer is a heterotrimeric complex that associates with endo-somal membranes and facilitates the retrograde sorting of mul-tiple receptors, including the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor for lysosomal enzymes. The cycling of ret-romer on and off the endosomal membrane is regulated by a network of retromer-interacting proteins. Here, we find that Parkinson disease-associated Vps35 variant, R524W, but not P316S, is a loss-of-function mutation as marked by a reduced association with this regulatory network and dysregulation of endosomal receptor sorting. Expression of Vps35 R524W-con-taining retromer results in the accumulation of intracellular ␣-synuclein-positive aggregates, a hallmark of Parkinson dis-ease. Overall, the Vps35 R524W-containing retromer has a decreased endosomal association, which can be partially res-cued by R55, a small molecule previously shown to stabilize the retromer complex, supporting the potential for future targeting of the retromer complex in the treatment of Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease (PD) 4 primarily affects the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, a small anatom-ical region located within the midbrain that regulates move-ment. On a cellular level, PD is a complex disease characterized by the subcellular formation of large, perinuclear accumula-tions of aggregated proteins, called Lewy bodies (LBs). The most abundant protein found in LBs is the presynaptic plasma membrane-associated protein ␣-synuclein, but they may also contain other proteins and lipids (1–3). The formation of LBs, which individual neurons are unable to clear, has been directly linked to activation of apoptotic pathways in the dopaminergic neurons (2). Rare familial mutations in a range of proteins have been iden-tified and have provided significant insight into the molecular pathways involved in the manifestation of PD (reviewed in Ref. 4). Recently, a number of point mutations (D620N, P316S, R524W, and L774M) within the retromer subunit Vps35 (vac-uolar protein sorting 35) were associated with late onset PD, and analysis of 144 individuals confirmed that overall levels of Vps35 mRNA in the substantia nigra were significantly decreased in PD-affected patients (5–7). Retromer is a hetero-trimeric complex composed of Vps29, Vps35, and one of the two Vps26 subunits, Vps26A or Vps26B (8 –10). Retromer has a central role in the sorting of receptor cargo within endosomal membranes, which is essential to coordinate the specific spatio-temporal localization of individual receptors, enabling them to perform their varied functions (11, 12). One such cargo is the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) that controls the sorting of lysosomal enzymes, such as cathepsin D, which is required for protein turnover (11–13). Retromer serves as a multifunctional scaffold forming an inter-action hub for a wide array of endosome-associated proteins, collectively termed the retromer interactome. These interac-tions aid in the formation of the cargo-containing tubulove-sicular membrane carriers destined for other compartments, such as the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. The diverse proteins that associate with retromer include regulatory mole-cules, proteins required for membrane recruitment, and pro-tein complexes that control membrane tubulation and scission (reviewed in Refs. 14 and 15). It is the spatial and temporal coordination of the interactions between the retromer and ret-romer interactome that enables it to coordinate multiple endo-some-derived trafficking pathways (16). Characterization of the PD-causing Vps35 D620N mutation demonstrated that Vps35 D620N-retromer is unable to cor-rectly traffic cargoes, such as CI-M6PR and post-synaptic AMPA receptors, the former of which results in improper pro-cessing and trafficking of cathepsin D (17, 18). Moreover, pre-vious reports suggest that the aforementioned sorting defect may arise from perturbed interactions with the WASH com-plex, a protein complex implicated in endosome-to-Golgi receptor sorting, and, consequently, may lead to a},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is escalating at alarming rates, demanding the development of additional classes of therapeutics to further reduce the burden of disease. Recent studies have indicated that increasing the metabolic activity of brown and beige adipose tissue may represent a novel means to reduce circulating glucose and lipids in people with T2D. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor that has recently been demonstrated to be important in potentially regulating the metabolic activity of brown and beige adipose tissue. The goal of this review is to summarize recent work describing the role of AMPK in brown and beige adipose tissue, focusing on its role in adipogenesis and non-shivering thermogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Ablation of AMPK in mouse adipocytes results in cold intolerance, a reduction in non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT), and the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance; effects associated with a defect in mitochondrial specific autophagy (mitophagy) within BAT. The effects of a beta3-adrenergic agonist on the induction of BAT thermogenesis and the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) are also blunted in mice lacking adipose tissue AMPK. A specific AMPK activator, A-769662, also results in the activation of BAT and the browning of WAT, effects which may involve demethylation of the PR domain containing 16 (Prdm16) promoter region, which is important for BAT development. AMPK plays an important role in the development and maintenance of brown and beige adipose tissue. Adipose tissue AMPK is reduced in people with insulin resistance, consistent with findings that mice lacking adipocyte AMPK develop greater NAFLD and insulin resistance. These data suggest that pharmacologically targeting adipose tissue AMPK may represent a promising strategy to enhance energy expenditure and reduce circulating glucose and lipids, which may be effective for the treatment of NAFLD and T2D.},

abstract = {Intense efforts are being undertaken to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms triggered after brain ischemia and to develop effective pharmacological treatments. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and not completely understood. One of the main problems is the fact that the ischemic damage is time-dependent and ranges from negligible to massive, involving different cell types such as neurons, astrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and some blood-derived cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, etc.). Thus, approaching such a complicated cellular response generates a more complex combination of molecular mechanisms, in which cell death, cellular damage, stress and repair are intermixed. For this reason, animal and cellular model systems are needed in order to dissect and clarify which molecular mechanisms have to be promoted and/or blocked. Brain ischemia may be analyzed from two different perspectives: that of oxygen deprivation (hypoxic damage per se) and that of deprivation of glucose/serum factors. For investigations of ischemic stroke, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is the preferred in vivo model, and uses two different approaches: transient (tMCAO), where reperfusion is permitted; or permanent (pMCAO). As a complement to this model, many laboratories expose different primary cortical neuron or neuronal cell lines to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). This ex vivo model permits the analysis of the impact of hypoxic damage and the specific response of different cell types implicated in vivo, such as neurons, glia or endothelial cells. Using in vivo and neuronal OGD models, it was recently established that mTORC1 (mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex-1), a protein complex downstream of PI3K-Akt pathway, is one of the players deregulated after ischemia and OGD. In addition, neuroprotective intervention either by estradiol or by specific AT2R agonists shows an important regulatory role for the mTORC1 activity, for instance regulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. This evidence highlights the importance of understanding the role of mTORC1 in neuronal death/survival processes, as it could be a potential therapeutic target. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art of the complex kinase mTORC1 focusing in upstream and downstream pathways, their role in central nervous system and their relationship with autophagy, apoptosis and neuroprotection/neurodegeneration after ischemia/hypoxia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that microRNA-27a (miR-27a) is involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. However, the exact function and molecular mechanism of miR-27a in gastric cancer remain unclear. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify the expression of miR-27a and its target gene. The function of miR-27a in gastric cancer was investigated through in vitro and in vivo assays (MTT assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry assay, wound healing assay, migration and invasion assay, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot). A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the target gene of miR-27a. RESULTS: We found that miR-27a was commonly overexpressed in gastric cancer and high expression of miR-27a was associated with distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis, advanced T stage and advanced clinical stage. Functional assays demonstrated that overexpression of miR-27a in AGS cells accelerated cell proliferation, migration and invasion and suppressed apoptosis. Meanwhile, opposite results were observed in SGC-7901 cells when miR-27a was suppressed. Consistently, down-regulation of miR-27a inhibited the growth and metastasis of engrafted tumors in vivo. Furthermore, we found PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) to be a new target of miR-27a, and downregulation of PHLPP2 could rescue the effect of anti-miR-27a in gastric cancer cells. In addition, miR-27a-mediated suppression of PHLPP2 led to stimulation of the AKT/GSK3beta pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that miR-27a functions as a crucial oncogenic miRNA in gastric cancer. It can promote proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells by suppressing PHLPP2 and activating the AKT/GSK3beta pathway. Therefore, miR-27a is a potential novel therapeutic target in gastric cancer treatment.},

abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common progressive disease that is typically characterized by the permanent loss of functional nephrons. As injured nephrons become sclerotic and die, the remaining healthy nephrons undergo numerous structural, molecular, and functional changes in an attempt to compensate for the loss of diseased nephrons. These compensatory changes enable the kidney to maintain fluid and solute homeostasis until approximately 75{\%} of nephrons are lost. As CKD continues to progress, glomerular filtration rate decreases, and remaining nephrons are unable to effectively eliminate metabolic wastes and environmental toxicants from the body. This inability may enhance mortality and/or morbidity of an individual. Environmental toxicants of particular concern are arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury. Since these metals are present throughout the environment and exposure to one or more of these metals is unavoidable, it is important that the way in which these metals are handled by target organs in normal and disease states is understood completely.},

abstract = {Metastasis suppressor genes (MSGs) have contributed to an understanding of regulatory pathways unique to the lethal metastatic process. When re-expressed in experimental models, MSGs block cancer spread to, and colonization of distant sites without affecting primary tumor formation. Genes have been identified with expression patterns inverse to a single MSG, and found to encode functional, druggable signaling pathways. We now hypothesize that common signaling pathways mediate the effects of multiple MSGs. By gene expression profiling of human MCF7 breast carcinoma cells expressing a scrambled siRNA, or siRNAs to each of 19 validated MSGs (NME1, BRMS1, CD82, CDH1, CDH2, CDH11, CASP8, MAP2K4, MAP2K6, MAP2K7, MAPK14, GSN, ARHGDIB, AKAP12, DRG1, CD44, PEBP1, RRM1, KISS1), we identified genes whose expression was significantly opposite to at least five MSGs. Five genes were selected for further analysis: PDE5A, UGT1A, IL11RA, DNM3 and OAS1. After stable downregulation of each candidate gene in the aggressive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231T, in vitro motility was significantly inhibited. Two stable clones downregulating PDE5A (phosphodiesterase 5A), an enzyme involved in the regulation of cGMP-specific signaling, exhibited no difference in cell proliferation, but reduced motility by 47 and 66 {\%} compared to the empty vector-expressing cells (p = 0.01 and p = 0.005). In an experimental metastasis assay, two shPDE5A-MDA-MB-231T clones produced 47-62 {\%} fewer lung metastases than shRNA-scramble expressing cells (p = 0.045 and p = 0.009 respectively). This study demonstrates that previously unrecognized genes are inversely related to the expression of multiple MSGs, contribute to aspects of metastasis, and may stand as novel therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The similarity or distance measure used for clustering can generate intuitive and interpretable clusters when it is tailored to the unique characteristics of the data. In time series datasets generated with high-throughput biological assays, measurements such as gene expression levels or protein phosphorylation intensities are collected sequentially over time, and the similarity score should capture this special temporal structure. RESULTS: We propose a clustering similarity measure called Lag Penalized Weighted Correlation (LPWC) to group pairs of time series that exhibit closely-related behaviors over time, even if the timing is not perfectly synchronized. LPWC aligns time series profiles to identify common temporal patterns. It down-weights aligned profiles based on the length of the temporal lags that are introduced. We demonstrate the advantages of LPWC versus existing time series and general clustering algorithms. In a simulated dataset based on the biologically-motivated impulse model, LPWC is the only method to recover the true clusters for almost all simulated genes. LPWC also identifies clusters with distinct temporal patterns in our yeast osmotic stress response and axolotl limb regeneration case studies. CONCLUSIONS: LPWC achieves both of its time series clustering goals. It groups time series with correlated changes over time, even if those patterns occur earlier or later in some of the time series. In addition, it refrains from introducing large shifts in time when searching for temporal patterns by applying a lag penalty.

In this study, the levels of miR-224 in different types of breast cancer tissues and cell lines were examined by quantitative RT-PCR and the potential targets of miR-224 in the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling were investigated. The effects of altered miR-224 expression on the frequency of CD44+CD24- cancer stem-like cells (CSC), proliferation and migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were examined by flow cytometry, MTT and transwell migration. We found that the levels of miR-224 expression in different types of breast cancer tissues and cell lines were associated inversely with aggressiveness of breast cancers. Enhanced miR-224 expression significantly reduced the fizzled 5-regulated luciferase activity in 293T cells, fizzled 5 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, the $\beta$-dependent luciferase activity in MCF-7 cells, and the nuclear translocation of $\beta$-catenin in MDA-MB-231 cells. miR-224 inhibition significantly increased the percentages of CSC in MCF-7 cells and enhanced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells. Enhanced miR-224 expression inhibited proliferation and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, and the growth of implanted breast cancers in vivo. Induction of Frizzled 5 over-expression mitigated the miR-224-mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation. Collectively, these data indicated that miR-224 down-regulated the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling possibly by binding to Frizzled 5 and inhibited proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells.},

Over the past decades, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome has increased dramatically, imposing a devastating, pandemic health threat. More importantly, individuals with metabolic syndrome are at an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and overall cardiovascular diseases. One of the common comorbidities of metabolic syndrome is heart anomalies leading to the loss of cardiomyocytes, cardiac dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Up-to-date, a plethora of cell signaling pathways have been postulated for the pathogenesis of cardiac complications in obesity including lipotoxicity, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and sympathetic overactivation although the precise mechanism of action underscoring obesity-associated heart dysfunction remains elusive. Recent evidence has indicated a potential role of protein quality control in components of metabolic syndrome. Within the protein quality control system, the autophagy-lysosome pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway responsible for bulk degradation of large intracellular organelles and protein aggregates. Autophagy has been demonstrated to play an indispensible role in the maintenance of cardiac geometry and function under both physiological and pathological conditions. Accumulating studies have demonstrated that autophagy plays a pivotal role in the etiology of cardiac anomalies under obesity and metabolic syndrome. In this minireview, we will discuss on how autophagy is involved in the regulation of cardiac function in obesity and metabolic syndrome.

abstract = {The high dimensionality of global transcription profiles, the expression level of 20,000 genes in a much small number of samples, presents challenges that affect the sensitivity and general applicability of analysis results. In principle, it would be better to describe the data in terms of a small number of metagenes, positive linear combinations of genes, which could reduce noise while still capturing the invariant biological features of the data. Here, we describe how to accomplish such a reduction in dimension by a metagene projection methodology, which can greatly reduce the number of features used to characterize microarray data. We show, in applications to the analysis of leukemia and lung cancer data sets, how this approach can help assess and interpret similarities and differences between independent data sets, enable cross-platform and cross-species analysis, improve clustering and class prediction, and provide a computational means to detect and remove sample contamination.},

Yet, imbalanced alleles, especially from diploid genome regions, are poorly explored in cancer. Here we systematically quantify and integrate the variant allele fraction from corresponding RNA and DNA sequence data from patients with breast cancer acquired through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We test for correlation between allele prevalence and functionality in known cancer-implicated genes from the Cancer Gene Census (CGC). We document significant allele-preferential expression of functional variants in CGC genes and across the entire dataset. Notably, we find frequent allele-specific overexpression of variants in tumor-suppressor genes. We also report a list of over-expressed variants from non-CGC genes. Overall, our analysis presents an integrated set of features of somatic allele expression and points to the vast information content of the asymmetric alleles in the cancer transcriptome.},

abstract = {The activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS), also known as p110delta-activating mutation causing senescent T cells, lymphadenopathy, and immunodeficiency (PASLI), is a combined immunodeficiency syndrome caused by gain-of-function mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) genes PIK3CD (encoding p110delta: APDS1 or PASLI-CD) and PIK3R1 (encoding p85alpha: APDS2 or PASLI-R1). While the disease is clinically heterogeneous, respiratory symptoms and complications are near universal and often severe. Infections of the ears, sinuses, and upper and lower respiratory tracts are the earliest and most frequent manifestation of APDS, secondary to both respiratory viruses and to bacterial pathogens typical of defective B cell function. End organ damage in the form of small airways disease and bronchiectasis frequently complicates APDS, but despite documented T cell defects, opportunistic infections have rarely been observed. Antimicrobial (principally antibiotic) prophylaxis and/or immunoglobulin replacement have been widely used to reduce the frequency and severity of respiratory infection in APDS, but outcome data to confirm the efficacy of these interventions are limited. Despite these measures, APDS patients are often afflicted by benign lymphoproliferative disease, which may present in the respiratory system as tonsillar/adenoidal enlargement, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, or mucosal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, potentially causing airways obstruction and compounding the infection phenotype. Treatment with rapamycin and PI3Kdelta inhibitors has been reported to be of benefit in benign lymphoproliferation, but hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ideally undertaken before permanent airway damage is established) remains the only curative treatment for APDS.},

abstract = {Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as the activated fibroblasts in tumor stroma, are important modifiers of tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor-promoting properties of CAFs in gastric cancer remain unclear. Here, we show that CAFs isolated from gastric cancer produce significant amounts of interleukin-6 (IL-6). CAFs enhances the migration and EMT of gastric cancer cells through the secretion of IL-6 that activates Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK2/STAT3) pathway in gastric cancer cells, while deprivation of IL-6 using a neutralizing antibody or inhibition of JAK/STAT3 pathway with specific inhibitor AG490 markedly attenuates these phenotypes in gastric cancer cells induced by CAFs. Moreover, silencing IL-6 expression in CAFs or inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 pathway in gastric cancer cells impairs tumor peritoneal metastasis induced by CAFs in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that CAFs in the tumor microenvironment promote the progression of gastric cancer through IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling, and IL-6 targeted therapy could be a complementary approach against gastric cancer by exerting their action on stromal fibroblasts.},

In this study, the role of autophagy in the differentiation of white adipose tissue was studied by deleting the autophagy-related 7 (atg7) gene from adipose tissue in mice. This deletion results in a striking phenotype at the cellular, tissue and whole-organism levels. Adipose tissue deposits in the mutant mice are much smaller in mass than those observed in their wild-type counterparts, and mutant adipocytes exhibit unusual morphological characteristics including multilocular lipid droplets and greatly increased numbers of mitochondria. The knockout mice are noticeably slimmer than their wild-type littermates, despite parity in food and water consumption. The mutant mice also exhibit higher basal physical activity levels and an array of metabolic changes revealed through blood tests. Most importantly, these mice show resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and markedly increased sensitivity to insulin. These findings establish a new function for autophagy and provide a new model system for use in the search for treatments for obesity and type II diabetes.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer (PC) is a leading male oncologic malignancy wideworld. During malignant transformation, normal epithelial cells undergo genetic and morphological changes known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Several regulatory genes and specific marker proteins are involved in PC EMT. Recently, syndecans have been associated with malignancy grade and Gleason score in PC. Considering that SNAIL is mainly a gene repressor increased in PC and that syndecan promoters have putative binding sites for this repressor, we propose that SNAIL might regulate syndecan expression during PC EMT. The aim of this study was to analyze immunochemically the expression of SNAIL, syndecans 1 and 2 and other EMT markers in a tissue microarray (TMA) of PC samples and PC cell lines. The TMAs included PC samples of different Gleason grade and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples, as nonmalignant controls. PC3 and LNCaP cell lines were used as models of PC representing different tumorigenic capacities. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed on TMAs and fluorescence immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis were conducted on cell cultures. Results show that SNAIL exhibits increased expression in high Gleason specimens compared to low histological grade and BPH samples. Accordingly, PC3 cells show higher SNAIL expression levels compared to LNCaP cells. Conversely, syndecan 1, similarly to E-cadherin (a known marker of EMT), shows a decreased expression in high Gleason grades samples and PC3 cells. Interestingly, syndecan 2 shows no changes associated to histological grade. It is concluded that increased SNAIL levels in advanced PC are associated with low expression of syndecan 1. The mechanism by which SNAIL regulates the expression of syndecan 1 remains to be investigated.},

Obesity develops when there is a greater caloric intake than energy expenditure. Promoting energy expenditure has recently attracted much attention as a promising approach for the management of body weight. Thermogenic adipocytes are capable of burning fat to dissipate chemical energy into heat, thereby enhancing energy expenditure. After the recent re-discovery of thermogenic adipocytes in adult humans, much effort has focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms, especially the epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate thermogenic adipocyte development and function. A number of chromatin signatures, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibilities, and interactions, have been profiled at the genome level and analyzed in various murine and human thermogenic fat cell systems. Moreover, writers and erasers, as well as readers of the epigenome are also investigated using genomic tools in thermogenic adipocytes. In this review, we summarize and discuss the recent advance in these studies and highlight the insights gained into the epigenomic regulation of thermogenic program as well as the pathogenesis of human metabolic diseases.},

Recent reports have demonstrated that NNK exposure may be associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance in certain cancers. However, the underlying NNK-induced mechanism contributing to the aggressiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, we used HT29 cells treated with NNK to simulate the long-term exposure of cigarette smoke. A comparative analysis was performed to evaluate cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and drug-resistance genes expression, cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, and anti-apoptotic activity. Signaling pathways related to chemoresistance were also investigated. As a result, NNK exposure dose-dependently stimulates cell proliferation, enhance abilities of migration and invasion, induce EMT phenomenon, and attenuate apoptosis. Furthermore, NNK exposure also promotes the capabilities of sphere formation, upregulation of Snail, and overexpression of CD133, Nanog, OCT4, and the drug-resistant genes. Knockdown of Snail results in upregulation of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), increased apoptosis, reversal of EMT phenomenon, and reducation of expression of CSC markers, all of which contribute to a decrease of chemoresistance. Our study demonstrates a number of related mechanisms that mediate the effect of NNK exposure on increasing CRC therapeutic resistance via the Snail signaling pathway. Targeting Snail may provide a feasible strategy for the treatment of CRC.},

@article{Hamza2009De-novoAdipogenesis.,
abstract = {BACKGROUND The pathophysiology of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with abnormalities in endocrine signaling in adipose tissue and one of the key signaling affectors operative in these disorders is the nuclear hormone transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). PPARgamma has pleiotropic functions affecting a wide range of fundamental biological processes including the regulation of genes that modulate insulin sensitivity, adipocyte differentiation, inflammation and atherosclerosis. To date, only a limited number of direct targets for PPARgamma have been identified through research using the well established pre-adipogenic cell line, 3T3-L1. In order to obtain a genome-wide view of PPARgamma binding sites, we applied the pair end-tagging technology (ChIP-PET) to map PPARgamma binding sites in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Coupling gene expression profile analysis with ChIP-PET, we identified in a genome-wide manner over 7700 DNA binding sites of the transcription factor PPARgamma and its heterodimeric partner RXR during the course of adipocyte differentiation. Our validation studies prove that the identified sites are bona fide binding sites for both PPARgamma and RXR and that they are functionally capable of driving PPARgamma specific transcription. Our results strongly indicate that PPARgamma is the predominant heterodimerization partner for RXR during late stages of adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, we find that PPARgamma/RXR association is enriched within the proximity of the 5' region of the transcription start site and this association is significantly associated with transcriptional up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism confirming the role of PPARgamma as the master transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis. Evolutionary conservation analysis of these binding sites is greater when adjacent to up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes, suggesting the primordial function of PPARgamma/RXR is in the induction of genes. Our functional validations resulted in identifying novel PPARgamma direct targets that have not been previously reported to promote adipogenic differentiation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE We have identified in a genome-wide manner the binding sites of PPARgamma and RXR during the course of adipogenic differentiation in 3T3L1 cells, and provide an important resource for the study of PPARgamma function in the context of adipocyte differentiation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarrays are becoming an increasingly common tool for observing changes in gene expression over a large cross section of the genome. This experimental tool is particularly valuable for understanding the genome-wide changes in gene transcription in response to thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment. The TZD class of drugs is known to improve insulin-sensitivity in diabetic patients, and is clinically used in treatment regimens. In cells, TZDs bind to and activate the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). Large-scale array analyses will provide some insight into the mechanisms of TZD-mediated insulin sensitization. Unfortunately, a theoretical basis for analyzing array data has not kept pace with the rapid adoption of this tool. The methods that are commonly used, particularly the fold-change approach and the standard t-test, either lack statistical rigor or resort to generalized statistical models that do not accurately estimate variability at low replicate numbers. RESULTS: We introduce a statistical framework that models the dependence of measurement variance on the level of gene expression in the context of a Bayesian hierarchical model. We compare several methods of parameter estimation and subsequently apply these to determine a set of genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that are differentially regulated in response to TZD treatment. When the number of experimental replicates is low (n = 2-3), this approach appears to qualitatively preserve an equivalent degree of specificity, while vastly improving sensitivity over other comparable methods. In addition, the statistical framework developed here can be readily applied to understand the implicit assumptions made in traditional fold-change approaches to array analysis.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The application of microarray chip technology has led to an explosion of data concerning the expression levels of the genes in an organism under a plethora of conditions. One of the major challenges of systems biology today is to devise generally applicable methods of interpreting this data in a way that will shed light on the complex relationships between multiple genes and their products. The importance of such information is clear, not only as an aid to areas of research like drug design, but also as a contribution to our understanding of the mechanisms behind an organism's ability to react to its environment. RESULTS: We detail one computational approach for using gene expression data to identify response networks in an organism. The method is based on the construction of biological networks given different sets of interaction information and the reduction of the said networks to important response sub-networks via the integration of the gene expression data. As an application, the expression data of known stress responders and DNA repair genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is used to construct a generic stress response sub-network. This is compared to similar networks constructed from data obtained from subjecting M.tuberculosis to various drugs; we are thus able to distinguish between generic stress response and specific drug response. We anticipate that this approach will be able to accelerate target identification and drug development for tuberculosis in the future.

abstract = {Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays can target either DNA (the genome) or RNA (the transcriptome). Targeting the genome generates robust data that are informative and, most importantly, generally applicable. This is because the information contained within the genome is context-independent; i.e., generally, every normal cell contains the same DNA sequence--the same mutations and polymorphisms. The transcriptome, on the other hand, is context-dependent; i.e., the mRNA complement and level varies with physiology, pathology, or development. This makes the information contained within the transcriptome intrinsically flexible and variable. If this variability is combined with the technical limitations inherent in any reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR assay, it can be difficult to achieve not just a technically accurate but a biologically relevant result. Template quality, operator variability, the RT step itself, and subjectivity in data analysis and reporting are just a few technical aspects that make real-time RT-PCR appear to be a fragile assay that makes accurate data interpretation difficult. There can be little doubt that in the future, transcriptome-based analysis will become a routine technique. However, for the time being it remains a research tool, and it is important to recognize the considerable pitfalls associated with transcriptome analysis, with the successful application of RTPCR depending on careful experimental design, application, and validation.},

abstract = {Cellular senescence is a cell cycle arrest accompanied by high expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors which counteract overactive growth signals, which serves as a tumor suppressive mechanism. Senescence can be a result of telomere shortening (natural or replicative senescence) or DNA damage resulting from exogenous stressors (induced senescence). Here, we performed gene expression profiling through RNA-seq of replicative senescence, adriamycin-induced senescence, H2O2-induced senescence, and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine-induced senescence in order to profile the pathways controlling various types of senescence. Overall, the pathways common to all 4 types of senescence were related to inflammation and the innate immune system. It was also evident that 5-aza-induced senescence mirrors natural replicative senescence due to telomere shortening. We also examined the prevalence of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors in the RNA-seq data, showing that it is a common characteristic of all 4 types of senescence. In addition, we could discriminate changes in gene expression due to quiescence during cellular senescence from those that were specific to senescence.},

abstract = {As a base for human transcriptome and functional genomics, we created the "full-length long Japan" (FLJ) collection of sequenced human cDNAs. We determined the entire sequence of 21,243 selected clones and found that 14,490 cDNAs (10,897 clusters) were unique to the FLJ collection. About half of them (5,416) seemed to be protein-coding. Of those, 1,999 clusters had not been predicted by computational methods. The distribution of GC content of nonpredicted cDNAs had a peak at approximately 58{\%} compared with a peak at approximately 42{\%}for predicted cDNAs. Thus, there seems to be a slight bias against GC-rich transcripts in current gene prediction procedures. The rest of the cDNAs unique to the FLJ collection (5,481) contained no obvious open reading frames (ORFs) and thus are candidate noncoding RNAs. About one-fourth of them (1,378) showed a clear pattern of splicing. The distribution of GC content of noncoding cDNAs was narrow and had a peak at approximately 42{\%}, relatively low compared with that of protein-coding cDNAs.},

Mitochondria form a dynamic, interconnected network that is intimately integrated with other cellular compartments.

It is therefore not surprising that mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a key factor in a myriad of diseases, including neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders.

However, there is a need to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic treatments for unresponsive patients. These may be achieved by the identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers which will help in the stratification of patients' initial responses to particular treatments and circumvent resistance, relapses, metastasis, and death. We have been investigating human prostate cancer as a model tumor. We have identified Yin Yang 1 (YY1), a dysregulated transcription factor, whose overexpression correlated with tumor progression as well as in the regulation of drug resistance and the development of EMT. YY1 expression is upregulated in human prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. We postulated that YY1 may be a potential biomarker in prostate cancer for patients' stratification as well as a novel target for therapeutic intervention. We used Bioinformatic gene RNA array datasets for the expression of YY1 in prostate tumor tissues as compared to normal tissues. Interestingly, variations on the expression levels of YY1 mRNA in prostate cancer were reported by different investigators. This mini review summarizes the current reported studies and Bioinformatic analyses on the role of YY1 in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. {\textcopyright} 2014, Impact Journals LLC.

abstract = {Background and objective: Cell migration, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis are the main processes in tissue regeneration. Mesenchymal Stem Cells have the potential to differentiate into many cell phenotypes such as tissue- or organ-specific cells to perform special functions. Experimental observations illustrate that differentiation and proliferation of these cells can be regulated according to internal forces induced within their Extracellular Matrix. The process of how exactly they interpret and transduce these signals is not well understood. Methods: A previously developed three-dimensional (3D) computational model is here extended and employed to study how force-free substrates and force-induced substrate control cell differentiation and/or proliferation during the mechanosensing process. Consistent with experimental observations, it is assumed that cell internal deformation (a mechanical signal) in correlation with the cell maturation state directly triggers cell differentiation and/or proliferation. The Extracellular Matrix is modeled as Neo-Hookean hyperelastic material assuming that cells are cultured within 3D nonlinear hydrogels. Results: In agreement with well-known experimental observations, the findings here indicate that within neurogenic (0.1-1 kPa), chondrogenic (20-25 kPa) and osteogenic (30-45 kPa) substrates, Mesenchymal Stem Cells differentiation and proliferation can be precipitated by inducing the substrate with an internal force. Therefore, cells require a longer time to grow and maturate within force-free substrates than within force-induced substrates. In the instance of Mesenchymal Stem Cells differentiation into a compatible phenotype, the magnitude of the net traction force increases within chondrogenic and osteogenic substrates while it reduces within neurogenic substrates. This is consistent with experimental studies and numerical works recently published by the same authors. However, in all cases the magnitude of the net traction force considerably increases at the instant of cell proliferation because of cell-cell interaction. Conclusions: The present model provides new perspectives to delineate the role of force-induced substrates in remotely controlling the cell fate during cell-matrix interaction, which open the door for new tissue regeneration methodologies.},

Pathophysiological consequences of improper autophagy give rise to a variety of age-related human diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Rational therapeutic implementation of autophagy modulation remains problematic, as fundamental molecular details such as the generation of autophagosomes, unique double-membrane vesicles formed to permit the process of autophagy, are insufficiently understood. Here, freeze-fracture replica immunolabelling reveals WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides 1 and 2 (WIPI-1 and WIPI-2) as membrane components of autophagosomes and the plasma membrane (PM). In addition, WIPI-1 is also present in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and WIPI-2 was further detected in membranes close to the Golgi cisternae. Our results identify WIPI-1 and WIPI-2 as novel protein components of autophagosomes, and of membrane sites from which autophagosomes might originate (ER, PM, Golgi area). Hence therapeutic modulation of autophagy could involve approaches that functionally target human WIPI proteins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure attributes to the formation of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC), which is mediated with DNA damage. DNA damage, an important factor for pathogenesis of ARNC, is induced by UVB, and is generally resolved by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) repair mechanism. Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein coded by ERCC6 is a vital component for NER. However, we found no association between selected ERCC6 polymorphisms and ARNC. In this study, we investigated whether UVB exposure could alter ERCC6 expression and the process could involve epigenetic changes of DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation of ERCC6 in the lens epithelial cells (LECs). We also assessed the involvement of those coordinated changes in lens tissue from ARNC patients. RESULTS: mRNA and protein expression of ERCC6 in lens tissue (LECs) were lower in ARNCs than those in the controls. This reduction corresponded to methylation of a CpG site at the ERCC6 promoter and histone modifications (methylation and acetylation) nearby this site. UVB-treated human lens epithelium B3 (HLE-B3) and 239T cell presented (1) increased apoptosis, suggesting reduced UV-damage repair, (2) hypermethylation of the CpG site located at position -441 (relative to transcription start site) within the binding region for transcriptional factor Sp1 in the ERCC6 promoter, (3) the enhancement of histone H3K9 deacetylation, (4) induction in DNA methyltransferases 3b (DNMT3b) and histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) associated to the CpG site of ERCC6 by CHIP assay. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an orchestrated mechanism triggered by UVB radiation where the concurrent association of specific hypermethylation CpG site, H3K9 deacetylation of ERCC6, and repression of ERCC6 gene expression. Taken together, with the similar changes in the lens tissue from ARNC patients, our data unveiled a possible mechanism of epigenetic modification of DNA repair gene in the pathogenesis of ARNC.},

abstract = {More than 30{\%} of patients with osteosarcoma succumb to pulmonary metastases. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process by which tumor cells gain an increased capacity for invasiveness and metastasis. A previous study confirmed the phenomenon of EMT in osteosarcoma, a mesenchymal-derived tumor. However, whether chemotherapy affects EMT remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the osteosarcoma cells were exposed to a sublethal dose of cisplatin, and any surviving cells were assumed to be more resistant to cisplatin. In addition, these cells exhibited a more mesenchymal phenotype. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the cisplatin treated cells had an increased long/short axis ratio and increased expression of N-cadherin compared with control cells. A panel of EMT-associated genes was subsequently assessed by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis, and they were observed to be significantly upregulated in the cisplatin treated cells. The in vitro wound healing and Transwell assay indicated that the cisplatin treated cells were more prone to migrate and invade. An in vivo assay showed that the cisplatin-treated xenograft had increased expression of EMT-associated genes, and exhibited increased pulmonary lesions compared with the control, which indicated an elevated capacity to metastasize. The expression of Snail was knocked down by specific small interfering RNA, and it was observed that Snail inhibition promoted cisplatin sensitivity, and cisplatin-induced EMT was significantly blocked. Taken together, the results of the present study supported that idea that Snail participates in cisplatin-induced EMT in osteosarcoma cells, and targeting EMT-transcription factors may offer promise for the therapeutics of osteosarcoma.

The differential expression profiles of miRNAs in different types of cancers and in the multi-step process of tumor progression indicate that miRNAs are involved in tumor onset, growth and progression. Metastasis is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality. Current evidence demonstrates that aberrant miRNA expression promotes or inhibits tumor metastasis by modulating the expression of numerous target genes. Therefore, the identification of metastasis-related miRNAs and a better understanding of the complex functions of miRNAs in tumor metastasis will provide potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets for clinical application.

abstract = {Cholangiocarcinoma cells originate in the biliary epithelium. The cells easily metastasize and cause relapse. The effect of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) on the biological behavior of cholangiocarcinoma cells is not yet clear. In the present study, RKIP and cytokeratin 19 expression was detected in the extrahepatic tissues of cholangiocarcinoma patients by immunohistochemistry. RKIP small interfering (si)RNA or an RKIP-overexpressing adenoviral vector were used to infect the human cholangiocarcinoma RBE cell line. RKIP protein or gene expression was analyzed by western blotting or reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), respectively. The cells were assayed for proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4 (TIMP-4) mRNA was assayed by RT-qPCR. RKIP expression was reduced in the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tumor compared with the adjacent uninvolved peritumoral tissues. The current study revealed that RKIP expression was positively correlated with cell differentiation, but negatively correlated with lymph node or distant metastasis (P{\textless}0.05). RKIP siRNA treatment promoted RBE cell invasion, but RKIP overexpression prevented cell invasion. In the pDC316-siRNA recombinant vector group, the cells migrated more quickly compared with the siRNA-negative control group, and in the RKIP-expressing adenoviral vector group, the cells migrated more slowly compared with the adenoviral negative control group. RKIP inhibited the invasive and metastatic ability of the cholangiocarcinoma cell line, RBE, by downregulating MMP-9 and upregulating TIMP-4 mRNA expression. RKIP is negatively associated with cholangiocarcinoma distant metastasis and prevents cholangiocarcinoma cell metastasis through downregulating MMP-9 expression and upregulating TIMP-4 expression.},

abstract = {Rosiglitazone (rosi) is a powerful insulin sensitizer, but serious toxicities have curtailed its widespread clinical use. Rosi functions as a high-affinity ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$), the adipocyte-predominant nuclear receptor (NR). The classic model, involving binding of ligand to the NR on DNA, explains positive regulation of gene expression, but ligand-dependent repression is not well understood. We addressed this issue by studying the direct effects of rosi on gene transcription using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq). Rosi-induced changes in gene body transcription were pronounced after 10 min and correlated with steady-state mRNA levels as well as with transcription at nearby enhancers (enhancer RNAs [eRNAs]). Up-regulated eRNAs occurred almost exclusively at PPAR$\gamma$-binding sites, to which rosi treatment recruited coactivators, including MED1, p300, and CBP. In contrast, transcriptional repression by rosi involved a loss of coactivators from eRNA sites devoid of PPAR$\gamma$ and enriched for other transcription factors, including AP-1 factors and C/EBPs. Thus, rosi activates and represses transcription by fundamentally different mechanisms that could inform the future development of anti-diabetic drugs.},

abstract = {Pan-cancer studies are particularly relevant not only for addressing the complexity of the inherently observed heterogeneity but also for identifying clinically relevant features that may be common to the cancer types. Immune system regulations usually reveal synergistic modulation with other cancer mechanisms and in combination provide insights on possible advances in cancer immunotherapies. Network inference is a powerful approach to decipher pan-cancer systems dynamics. The methodology proposed in this study elucidates the impacts of epigenetic treatment on the drivers of complex pan-cancer regulation circuits involving cell lines of five cancer types. These patterns were observed from differential gene expression measurements following demethylation with 5-azacytidine. Networks were built to establish associations of phenotypes at molecular level with cancer hallmarks through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms. The most prominent feature that emerges from our integrative network maps, linking pathway landscapes to disease and drug-target associations, refers primarily to a mosaic of immune-system crosslinked influences. Therefore, characteristics initially evidenced in single cancer maps become motifs well summarized by network cores and fingerprints.},

The mRNA levels of Hmox1, Nrf2, Keap1, and Bach1 in the tumor and normal tissues of 84 subjects with colorectal cancer (CRC) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The tumor had lower Hmox1 but higher Bach1 mRNA levels than the normal tissue. The correlations of Hmox1 with components of the Nrf2 pathway were not significant in the tumor tissue of CRC subjects with distant metastasis. The ratio of Hmox1/Nrf2 mRNA level (by percentage) in the tumor tissue was lower in the subjects with distant metastasis (97.4{\%} (84.4–111.1{\%})) than in those without (101.0{\%} (92.7–136.5{\%})) and was a predictor for distant metastasis in CRC (odds ratio: 0.83; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.68–0.97) along with serum carcinoembryonic antigen (1.0027, 1.006–1.064). The mRNA level of Hmox1 in the tumor tissue of CRC is not correlated with that of the Nrf2 pathway molecules, and its ratio to the Nrf2 level may be useful for suggesting distant metastasis in CRC.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Our understanding of the significance of interactions of proteins with DNA in the context of gene expression, cell differentiation or to some extent disease has immensely been enhanced by the advent of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP has been widely used to map the localization of post-translationally modified histones or histone variants on the genome or on a specific gene locus, or to map the association of transcription factors or chromatin modifying enzymes to the genome. In spite of its power, ChIP is a cumbersome procedure and typically requires large numbers of cells. This review outlines variations elaborated on the ChIP assay to shorten the procedure, make it suitable for small cell numbers and unravel the multiplicity of histone modifications on a single locus. In addition, the combination of ChIP assays with DNA microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies has in recent years enabled the profiling of histone modifications and transcription factor occupancy sites throughout the genome and in a high-resolution manner throughout a genomic region of interest. We also review applications of ChIP to the mapping of histone modifications or transcription factor binding at the genome-wide level. Finally, we speculate on future perspectives opened by the combination of emerging ChIP-related technologies.},

abstract = {The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent pathway is one of the most integral pathways linked to cell metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This pathway is dysregulated in a variety of diseases, including neoplasia, immune-mediated diseases, and fibroproliferative diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis. The mTOR kinase is frequently referred to as the master regulator of this pathway. Alterations in mTOR signaling are closely associated with dysregulation of autophagy, inflammation, and cell growth and survival, leading to the development of lung fibrosis. Inhibitors of mTOR have been widely studied in cancer therapy, as they may sensitize cancer cells to radiation therapy. Studies also suggest that mTOR inhibitors are promising modulators of fibroproliferative diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF). Therefore, mTOR represents an attractive and unique therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we discuss the pathological role of mTOR kinase in pulmonary fibrosis and examine how mTOR inhibitors may mitigate fibrotic progression. },

Once detached, cancer cells in circulation must also acquire survival mechanisms. Although many may successfully disseminate, variation exists in the efficiency with which circulating tumor cells home to and invade the bone marrow as metastastic seeds. Disseminated tumor cells that do successfully invade the marrow are secured by cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix adhesion. However, establishing a foothold in the marrow is not sufficient for disseminated tumor cells to create metastases. A significant latent phase must be overcome by either rescuing cellular proliferation or attenuating micrometastatic mass dormancy programs. Finally, growing metastases fuel osteolysis, osteoblastogenesis and T-cell differentiation, creating a variety of tumor phenotypes. Each step in the metastatic cascade is rich in biological targets and mechanistic pathways.},

We identified an amino acid exchange in exon 6 (Ala222Ser) and a synonymous variation in exon 4 (Pro139Pro). Subsequently, these two variations and four additional non-coding polymorphisms (-526 C/G, two polymorphisms in intron 1 and one in the 3'UTR) were genotyped in 317 AD patients and 224 healthy controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The -526G allele showed borderline association with AD in our cohort (p = 0.012; significance level after correction for multiple testing 0.0102).

abstract = {We have analyzed the cellular pathways and metabolic adaptations that take place in primary skin fibroblasts from patients with mutations in BCS1L, a major genetic cause of mitochondrial complex III enzyme deficiency. Mutant fibroblasts exhibited low oxygen consumption rates and intracellular ATP levels, indicating that the main altered molecular event probably is a limited respiration-coupled ATP production through the OXPHOS system. Two-dimensional DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry analyses unambiguously identified 39 proteins whose expression was significantly altered in complex III-deficient fibroblasts. Extensive statistical and cluster analyses revealed a protein profile characteristic for the BCS1L mutant fibroblasts that included alterations in energy metabolism, cell signaling and gene expression regulation, cytoskeleton formation and maintenance, and intracellular stress responses. The physiological validation of the predicted functional adaptations of human cultured fibroblasts to complex III deficiency confirmed the up-regulation of glycolytic enzyme activities and the accumulation of branched-chain among other amino acids, suggesting the activation of anaerobic glycolysis and cellular catabolic states, in particular protein catabolism, together with autophagy as adaptive responses to mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction and ATP deficiency. Our data point to an overall metabolic and genetic reprogramming that could contribute to explain the clinical manifestations of complex III deficiency in patients. Biological significance: Despite considerable knowledge about their genetic origins, the pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the clinical manifestations of mitochondrial disorders remain poorly understood. We have investigated the molecular pathways and metabolic adaptations that take place in primary skin fibroblasts from patients with mutations in the BCS1L gene, a primary cause of mitochondrial complex III enzyme deficiency. Two-dimensional DIGE together with MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and physiological validation analyses revealed a significant metabolic and genetic reprogramming as an adaptive response to mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction.

abstract = {Like many other human cancers, the development of malignant mesothelioma is closely associated with a chronic inflammatory condition. Both macrophages and mesothelial cells play crucial roles in the inflammatory response caused by asbestos exposure. Here, we show that adipocytes can also contribute to asbestos-induced inflammation through dysregulated adipocytokine production. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes prior to use. These cells took up asbestos fibers (chrysotile, crocidolite and amosite) but were more resistant to asbestos-induced injury than macrophages and mesothelial cells. Expression microarray analysis followed by reverse transcription-PCR revealed that adipocytes respond directly to asbestos exposure with an increased production of proinflammatory adipocytokines [e.g. monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)], whereas the production of anti-inflammatory adipocytokines (e.g. adiponectin) is suppressed. This was confirmed in epididymal fat pad of mice after intraperitoneal injection of asbestos fibers. Such dysregulated adipocytokine production favors the establishment of a proinflammatory environment. Furthermore, MCP-1 marginally promoted the growth of MeT-5A mesothelial cells and significantly enhanced the wound healing of Y-MESO-8A and Y-MESO-8D human mesothelioma cells. Our results suggest that increased levels of adipocytokines, such as MCP-1, can potentially contribute to the promotion of mesothelial carcinogenesis through the enhanced recruitment of inflammatory cells as well as a direct growth and migration stimulatory effect on mesothelial and mesothelioma cells. Taken together, our findings support a potential cancer-promoting role of adipocytes in asbestos-induced mesothelial carcinogenesis. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

For this, inflammation was induced by injecting 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid to the colon of male Wistar rats. Samples were taken from both inflamed and uninflamed regions of the same colon, total RNA was isolated, and the mRNA and microRNA expressions were monitored. We have determined that the expression of genes responsible for inducing mesenchymal phenotype, such as Egr1, Fgf2, Fgf7, Jak2, Notch2, Hif1, Zeb2, Mmp9, Lox, and Vim, was all significantly induced in the inflamed regions of the affected colons while the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Cdh1) was downregulated. In contrast, the expression of microRNAs miR-192, miR-143, miR-375, miR-30a, miR-107, and miR-200b responsible for the regulation of the above mentioned genes was significantly downregulated in inflamed colon. Importantly, we detected moderate induction in the expression of five out of six tested microRNAs in the uninflamed regions. In summary, we identified numerous interacting genes and microRNAs with mutually exclusive expression pattern in inflamed regions of colitis-induced rats.

Dysregulation of ERCC family members has been shown to be involved in chemoresistance in several malignancies. However, the function of ERCC6 in regulating chemo response has not been evaluated in colorectal cancer (CRC). We stably knocked down ERCC6 expression using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in HCT116 and DLD1 human colon cancer cell lines, followed by chemosensitivity assay. In vivo chemosensitizing effects of ERCC6 were examined in xenograft experiments. Downregulation of ERCC6 conferred sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in HCT116 and DLD1 cells. Stable knockdown of ERCC6 significantly enhanced antitumor activity of 5-FU in HCT116 xenograft mouse model. ERCC6 was upregulated in CRC tissues compared to matched noncancerous adjacent tissues and was also upregulated in patients who were resistant to 5-FU treatment. In addition, high expression of ERCC6 was associated with poor overall survival in CRC patients with or without receiving 5-FU therapy. Elevated expression of ERCC6 contributes to chemoresistance in CRC cells. Low ERCC6 expression is associated with better chemo response and survival in CRC patients. Therefore, this protein represents a novel therapeutic target for improvement of chemotherapeutic efficacy and predictive biomarker for patient survival.},

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a main bioactive component of honeybee hive propolis. Transwell and wound healing assays demonstrated that CAPE treatment suppressed the migration and invasion of PC-3 and DU-145 PCa cells. Gelatin zymography and Western blotting indicated that CAPE treatment reduced the abundance and activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2. Analysis using Micro-Western Array (MWA), a high-throughput antibody-based proteomics platform with 264 antibodies detecting signaling proteins involved in important pathways indicated that CAPE treatment induced receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway but suppressed abundance of beta-catenin, NF-kappaB activity, PI3K-Akt signaling, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Overexpression or knockdown of ROR2 suppressed or enhanced cell migration of PC-3 cells, respectively. TCF-LEF promoter binding assay revealed that CAPE treatment reduced canonical Wnt signaling. Intraperitoneal injection of CAPE reduced the metastasis of PC-3 xenografts in tail vein injection nude mice model. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that CAPE treatment increased abundance of ROR2 and Wnt5a but decreased protein expression of Ki67, Frizzle 4, NF-kappaB p65, MMP-9, Snail, beta-catenin, and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. Clinical evidences suggested that genes affected by CAPE treatment (CTNNB1, RELA, FZD5, DVL3, MAPK9, SNAl1, ROR2, SMAD4, NFKBIA, DUSP6, and PLCB3) correlate with the aggressiveness of PCa. Our study suggested that CAPE may be a potential therapeutic agent for patients with advanced PCa.},

In most cases, the causes are unknown and, most importantly, there are no reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. The search for sensitive biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is currently a fast growing field. We carried out proteomics analysis of 93 urinary samples of healthy subjects (HS) and patients affected by ccRCC, prostate cancer (PCa) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), that was able to successfully distinguish each group. The most significant candidate biomarker was identified by mass spectrometry as Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP), a key regulator of cell signaling, already described in several cancer types as a metastasis suppressor. By combining ELISA, immunoblotting and tissue microarray, we demonstrated that, in ccRCC, urinary excretion of RKIP and its phosphorylated form (p-RKIP) reflected the tissue expression of these putative biomarkers. Baseline urinary RKIP, evaluated in an independent cohort of 56 ccRCC patients and 28 HS, successfully distinguished both groups and, most importantly, a cut-off value of 10 ng/mg/g Pr/uCr enabled a highly accurate prediction of Cancer-specific survival and Progression-free survival. Furthermore, p-RKIP was totally undetectable in both tissue and urine samples of ccRCC, showing a great potential for diagnostics purposes. Our data indicate that urinary RKIP encompasses both the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated form and that their combined evaluation can help in the diagnosis and prognosis of ccRCC.},

In this study we found the stress-regulated protein p8 was obviously increased after DHA treatment in several cancer cells, which further to induce autophagy by the upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related protein ATF4 and CHOP. Furthermore, when we silenced p8 by siRNA in cancer cells, the apoptosis induced by DHA were notably increased, whereas the overexpression of p8 in cancer cells leaded to the resistance to DHA-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we found the inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) can enhance the anticancer effect of DHA both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we found that p8-mediated autophagy attenuates DHA-induced apoptosis in cancer cells, which provides evidence to support the use p8 as a cancer therapeutic target, and suggests that the combination treatment with DHA and autophagy inhibitor might be an effective cancer therapeutic strategy. {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes is a free radical molecule involved in a wide variety of normophysiologic and pathophysiologic processes. Included in the latter category are cancer promotion, progression, and resistance to therapeutic intervention. Animal tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) studies several years ago revealed that endogenous NO can reduce PDT efficacy and that NOS inhibitors can alleviate this. Until relatively recently, little else was known about this anti-PDT effect of NO, including: (a) the underlying mechanisms; (b) type(s) of NOS involved; and (c) whether active NO was generated in vascular cells, tumor cells, or both. In addressing these questions for various cancer cell lines exposed to PDT-like conditions, the author's group has made several novel findings, including: (i) exogenous NO can scavenge lipid-derived free radicals arising from photostress, thereby protecting cells from membrane-damaging chain peroxidation; (ii) cancer cells can upregulate inducible NOS (iNOS) after a PDT-like challenge and the resulting NO can signal for resistance to photokilling; (iii) photostress-surviving cells with elevated iNOS/NO proliferate and migrate/invade more aggressively; and (iv) NO produced by photostress-targeted cells can induce greater aggressiveness in non-targeted bystander cells. In this article, the author briefly discusses these various means by which NO can interfere with PDT and how this may be mitigated by use of NOS inhibitors as PDT adjuvants.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, {\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. Cigarette smoke (CS)-induced accumulation of mitochondrial damage has been widely implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis. Mitophagy plays a crucial role in eliminating damaged mitochondria, and is governed by the PINK1 (PTEN induced putative protein kinase 1)-PRKN (parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) pathway. Although both increased PINK1 and reduced PRKN have been implicated in COPD pathogenesis in association with mitophagy, there are conflicting reports for the role of mitophagy in COPD progression. To clarify the involvement of PRKN-regulated mitophagy in COPD pathogenesis, prkn knockout (KO) mouse models were used. To illuminate how PINK1 and PRKN regulate mitophagy in relation to CS-induced mitochondrial damage and cellular senescence, overexpression and knockdown experiments were performed in airway epithelial cells (AEC). In comparison to wild-type mice, prkn KO mice demonstrated enhanced airway wall thickening with emphysematous changes following CS exposure. AEC in CS-exposed prkn KO mice showed accumulation of damaged mitochondria and increased oxidative modifications accompanied by accelerated cellular senescence. In vitro experiments showed PRKN overexpression was sufficient to induce mitophagy during CSE exposure even in the setting of reduced PINK1 protein levels, resulting in attenuation of mitochondrial ROS production and cellular senescence. Conversely PINK1 overexpression failed to recover impaired mitophagy caused by PRKN knockdown, indicating that PRKN protein levels can be the rate-limiting factor in PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy during CSE exposure. These results suggest that PRKN levels may play a pivotal role in COPD pathogenesis by regulating mitophagy, suggesting that PRKN induction could mitigate the progression of COPD.

abstract = {Tumor metastasis is driven not only by the accumulation of intrinsic alterations in malignant cells, but also by the interactions of cancer cells with various stromal cell components of the tumor microenvironment. In particular, inflammation and infiltration of the tumor tissue by host immune cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T cells, have been shown to support tumor growth in addition to invasion and metastasis. Each step of tumor development, from initiation through metastatic spread, is promoted by communication between tumor and immune cells via the secretion of cytokines, growth factors, and proteases that remodel the tumor microenvironment. Invasion and metastasis require neovascularization, breakdown of the basement membrane, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix for tumor cell invasion and extravasation into the blood and lymphatic vessels. The subsequent dissemination of tumor cells to distant organ sites necessitates a treacherous journey through the vasculature, which is fostered by close association with platelets and macrophages. Additionally, the establishment of the pre-metastatic niche and specific metastasis organ tropism is fostered by neutrophils and bone marrow-derived hematopoietic immune progenitor cells and other inflammatory cytokines derived from tumor and immune cells, which alter the local environment of the tissue to promote adhesion of circulating tumor cells. This review focuses on the interactions between tumor cells and immune cells recruited to the tumor microenvironment and examines the factors allowing these cells to promote each stage of metastasis.},

abstract = {Naturally occurring phenolic compounds have been shown to sensitize prostate cancer cells to tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. TRAIL is a potent stimulator of apoptosis in cancer cells and an important immune effector molecule in the surveillance and elimination of developing tumours. However, many cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL-mediated death. In this study, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which TRAIL resistance can be overcome in prostate cancer cells by 3,5-diprenyl-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (artepillin C). Artepillin C is a bioactive component of Brazilian green propolis that possesses antitumour and chemopreventive activities. TRAIL-resistant LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with TRAIL and artepillin C. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-FITC staining by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Death receptor (DR) (TRAIL-R1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5) expression was analyzed using flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential (∆$\psi$m) was evaluated using DePsipher staining by fluorescence micro-scopy. The inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B (p65) activation was confirmed with the ELISA-based TransAM NF-$\kappa$B kit. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities were determined by colorimetric protease assays. The results showed that artepillin C sensitized the TRAIL-resistant LNCaP cells by engaging the extrinsic (receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathways. Artepillin C increased the expression of TRAIL-R2 and decreased the activity of NF-$\kappa$B. Co-treatment with TRAIL and artepillin C induced the significant activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, as well as the disruption of ∆$\psi$m. These findings show that prostate cancer cells can be sensitized to TRAIL-mediated immunoprevention by artepillin C and confirm the role of phenolic compounds in prostate cancer immunochemoprevention.},

LCV formation is a complex process that involves a plethora of type IV-secreted effector proteins. The effector RidL binds the Vps29 retromer subunit, blocks retrograde vesicle trafficking, and promotes intracellular bacterial replication. Here, we reveal that the 29-kDa N-terminal domain of RidL (RidL2–281) adopts a “foot-like” fold comprising a protruding $\beta$-hairpin at its “heel”. The deletion of the $\beta$-hairpin, the exchange to Glu of Ile170 in the $\beta$-hairpin, or Leu152 in Vps29 abolishes the interaction in eukaryotic cells and in vitro. RidL2–281 or RidL displace the Rab7 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TBC1D5 from the retromer and LCVs, respectively, and TBC1D5 promotes the intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. Thus, the hydrophobic $\beta$-hairpin of RidL is critical for binding of the L. pneumophila effector to the Vps29 retromer subunit and displacement of the regulator TBC1D5.},

abstract = {Regenerative medicine and cell therapy provide great hopes for the use of adult and stem cells. The latter are far less present in tissue than the former and must be expanded using cell culture. Stem cells culture requires the conservation of their proliferation and self-renewal capabilities. Still, the complex interaction between cell populations, for example in primary cell cultures, are not well-known and may account for part of the variability of such cultures. In order to represent and understand the evolution of cultured stem cells, we present here a mathematical model of cell proliferation and differentiation. Based on the formalism of cellular automata, this model simulates the evolution of several cell classes (which may represent either different levels of differentiation or different cell types) in an environment modeling the growth medium. We model the cell cycle as on the one hand a quiescence phase during which a cell rests, and on the other hand a division phase during which the cell starts the division process. In order to represent cell-cell interaction, the transition probability between those phases depends on the local composition of the growth medium depending itself on neighboring cells. An interaction between cellular populations is represented by a quantitative parameter which has a direct impact on cellular proliferation. Differentiation results in a change of the cell class and depends on the biological model studied : it may result from an asymmetric division or be a consequence of the local composition of the growth medium. This mathematical model aims at a better understanding of the interactions between cell populations in a culture. By defining constraints on the potential or the type of the cells at the end of a culture, it will then be possible to find optimal experimental conditions for cell production. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Although somatic mutations in the PI3K pathway genes PIK3CA and PTEN are known to drive PI3K pathway activation and cancer growth, the significance of somatic mutations in other PI3K pathway genes is less clear. Here, we establish the signaling and oncogenic properties of a recurrent somatic mutation in the PI3K p110$\beta$ isoform that resides within its kinase domain (PIK3C$\beta$(D1067V)). We initially observed PIK3C$\beta$(D1067V) by exome sequencing analysis of an EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor biopsy from a patient with acquired erlotinib resistance. On the basis of this finding, we hypothesized that PIK3C$\beta$(D1067V) might function as a novel tumor-promoting genetic alteration, and potentially an oncogene, in certain cancers. Consistent with this hypothesis, analysis of additional tumor exome data sets revealed the presence of PIK3C$\beta$(D1067V) at low frequency in other patient tumor samples (including renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, thyroid carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma). Functional studies revealed that PIK3C$\beta$(D1067V) promoted PI3K pathway signaling, enhanced cell growth in vitro, and was sufficient for tumor formation in vivo. Pharmacologic inhibition of PIK3C$\beta$ with TGX-221 (isoform-selective p110$\beta$ inhibitor) specifically suppressed growth in patient-derived renal-cell carcinoma cells with endogenous PIK3C$\beta$(D1067V) and in NIH-3T3 and human EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells engineered to express this mutant PI3K. In the EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells, expression of PIK3C$\beta$(D1067V) also promoted erlotinib resistance. Our data establish a novel oncogenic form of PI3K, revealing the signaling and oncogenic properties of PIK3C$\beta$(D1067V) and its potential therapeutic relevance in cancer. Our findings provide new insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying PI3K pathway activation in human tumors and indicate that PIK3C$\beta$(D1067V) is a rational therapeutic target in certain cancers.Oncogene advance online publication, 18 May 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.173.},

It combines multiple genome-wide epigenomic maps, and uses combinatorial and spatial mark patterns to infer a complete annotation for each cell type. ChromHMM learns chromatin-state signatures using a multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM) that explicitly models the combinatorial presence or absence of each mark. ChromHMM uses these signatures to generate a genome-wide annotation for each cell type by calculating the most probable state for each genomic segment. ChromHMM provides an automated enrichment analysis of the resulting annotations to facilitate the functional interpretations of each chromatin state. ChromHMM is distinguished by its modeling emphasis on combinations of marks, its tight integration with downstream functional enrichment analyses, its speed, and its ease of use. Chromatin states are learned, annotations are produced, and enrichments are computed within 1 d.},

abstract = {Chromatin profiling has emerged as a powerful means of genome annotation and detection of regulatory activity. The approach is especially well suited to the characterization of non-coding portions of the genome, which critically contribute to cellular phenotypes yet remain largely uncharted. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell-type specificities and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell-type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multicell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell-type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease single nucleotide polymorphisms are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus suggesting a mechanism for the association. Our study presents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory connections and their roles in disease. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The core-promoter, a stretch of DNA surrounding the transcription start site (TSS), is a major integration-point for regulatory-signals controlling gene-transcription. Cellular differentiation is marked by divergence in transcriptional repertoire and cell-cycling behaviour between cells of different fates. The role promoter-associated gene-regulatory-networks play in development-associated transitions in cell-cycle-dynamics is poorly understood. This study demonstrates in a vertebrate embryo, how core-promoter variations define transcriptional output in cells transitioning from a proliferative to cell-lineage specifying phenotype. Assessment of cell proliferation across zebrafish embryo segmentation, using the FUCCI transgenic cell-cycle-phase marker, revealed a spatial and lineage-specific separation in cell-cycling behaviour. To investigate the role differential promoter usage plays in this process, cap-analysis-of-gene-expression (CAGE) was performed on cells segregated by cycling dynamics. This analysis revealed a dramatic increase in tissue-specific gene expression, concurrent with slowed cycling behaviour. We revealed a distinct sharpening in TSS utilization in genes upregulated in slowly cycling, differentiating tissues, associated with enhanced utilization of the TATA-box, in addition to Sp1 binding-sites. In contrast, genes upregulated in rapidly cycling cells carry broad distribution of TSS utilization, coupled with enrichment for the CCAAT-box. These promoter features appear to correspond to cell-cycle-dynamic rather than tissue/cell-lineage origin. Moreover, we observed genes with cell-cycle-dynamic-associated transitioning in TSS distribution and differential utilization of alternative promoters. These results demonstrate the regulatory role of core-promoters in cell-cycle-dependent transcription regulation, during embryo-development.},

abstract = {Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiate to adipocytes in the presence of insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine (IDI). A transient increase of DNA synthesis is induced in 3T3-L1 cells 18 h after addition of IDI, followed by an arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Growth arrested cells express the protooncogene c-myc and the gene for the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP$\alpha$) between day 2 and 5. While c-Myc is strongly implicated in cell proliferation, C/EBP$\alpha$ is a differentiation-specific transcription factor with anti-proliferative activity. Here we have characterized the cell cycle arrest in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. Arrested cells express the Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27, but, at the same time, show hyperphosphorylation of Rb and expression of the E2F-regulated thymidine kinase gene. The addition of new serum to arrested cells resulted in cyclin A expression and Cdk2 activity, but not in DNA synthesis. Simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (LTAg) is a potent mitogen. The mutant LTAg-K1, deficient in binding of pocket proteins and unable to induce DNA synthesis in serum-starved 3T3-L1 cells, efficiently induced DIVA synthesis in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. This indicates that packet proteins are probably not involved in the control of the cell cycle arrest during 3T3-L1 cell differentiation. Our data suggest that the differentiation-specific cell cycle block in 3T3-L1 cells is resistant to high levels of c-Myc, inactivation of pocket proteins, upregulation of cyclin A levels, and Cdk2 activation, but can be abolished by a function of LTAg that is independent of binding to pocket proteins.},

However, the underlying mechanisms that regulate mitotic clonal expansion remain elusive. SIRT6 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+-dependent protein deacetylases. Here, we show that SIRT6 deficiency in preadipocytes blocks their adipogenesis. Analysis of gene expression during adipogenesis reveals that KIF5C, which belongs to the kinesin family, is negatively regulated by SIRT6. Furthermore, we show that KIF5C is a negative factor for adipogenesis through interacting with CK2$\alpha$′, a catalytic subunit of CK2. This interaction blocks CK2$\alpha$′ nuclear translocation and CK2 kinase activity and inhibits mitotic clonal expansion during adipogenesis. These findings reveal a crucial role of SIRT6 in adipogenesis and provide potential therapeutic targets for obesity.},

Here, we are investigating the effect of the apigetrin on adipocytes differentiation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and elucidating the mechanism of its action. Methods: Lipids accumulation was measured by Oil Red O staining and cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The antioxidant effect of apigetrin was evaluated against hydrogen peroxide. The expression of various genes, involved in adipogenesis and inflammation, was studied by real-time PCR. Results: Our results showed that apigterin treatment inhibited significantly lipid accumulation without effect on cell viability at 100 $\mu$M, and it exerted the anti-adipogenic effect during the early stages of differentiation. Flow cytometry analysis showed that apigenin-7-O-glucoside (Ap7G) inhibited cell proliferation during mitotic clonal expansion and caused cell cycle delay. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the mRNA levels of C/EBP-$\alpha$, PPAR-$\gamma$, SREBP-1c and FAS were suppressed after apigetrin treatment at 100 $\mu$M. Moreover, the mRNA level of pro-inflammatory genes (TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6) were suppressed after apigterin treatment, at high concentration preadipocyte cells. Conclusion: Taken together, these results indicated that apigenin-7-O-glucoside inhibits adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at early stage of adipogenesis.},

The population's expression pattern is modeled as the linear combination of mRNA expression from pure samples of cells, allowing reconstruction of the relative proportions of pure cell types in the population. Application of the method, termed expression deconvolution, to yeast grown under varying conditions reveals the population dynamics of the cells during the cell cycle, during the arrest of cells induced by DNA damage and the release of arrest in a cell cycle checkpoint mutant, during sporulation, and following environmental stress. Using expression deconvolution, cell cycle defects are detected and temporally ordered in 146 yeast deletion mutants; six of these defects are independently experimentally validated. Expression deconvolution allows a reinterpretation of the cell cycle dynamics underlying all previous microarray experiments and can be more generally applied to study most forms of cell population dynamics.},

Using periodicity and correlation algorithms, we identified 800 genes that meet an objective minimum criterion for cell cycle regulation. In separate experiments, designed to examine the effects of inducing either the G1 cyclin Cln3p or the B-type cyclin Clb2p, we found that the mRNA levels of more than half of these 800 genes respond to one or both of these cyclins. Furthermore, we analyzed our set of cell cycle-regulated genes for known and new promoter elements and show that several known elements (or variations thereof) contain information predictive of cell cycle regulation.

Using adipose tissue-derived human mesenchymal stem cells as an in vitro cell model for adipogenic study, a group of cell cycle regulators, including Cdk1 and CCND1, were found to be downregulated as early as 24 h after adipogenic initiation and consistently, cell proliferation activity was restricted to the first 48 h of adipogenic induction. Cell proliferation was either further inhibited using siRNAs targeting cell cycle genes or enhanced by supplementing exogenous growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), at specific time intervals during adipogenesis. Expression knockdown of Cdk1 at the initiation of adipogenic induction resulted in significantly increased adipocytes, even though total number of cells was significantly reduced compared to siControl-treated cells. bFGF stimulated proliferation throughout adipogenic differentiation, but exerted differential effect on adipogenic outcome at different phases, promoting adipogenesis during mitotic phase (first 48 h), but significantly inhibiting adipogenesis during adipogenic commitment phase (days 3-6). Our results demonstrate that cellular proliferation is counteractive to adipogenic commitment in human adipogenesis. However, cellular proliferation stimulation can be beneficial for adipogenesis during the mitotic phase by increasing the population of cells capable of committing to adipocytes before adipogenic commitment.},

Human MSCs were differentiated into chondrocytes and osteoblasts as per previous approaches. Cytochalasin D (CytD) was used to temporarily disrupt cytoskeleton in hMSCs, hMSC-chondrocytes (hMSC-Cys) and hMSC-osteoblasts (hMSC-Obs). Fluorescence microscopy revealed a dose-dependent response to CytD. Removal of CytD from the media of cytoskeleton-disrupted cells led to the recovery of the cytoskeletal structures, as confirmed by both fluorescence microscopy and AFM. Force-volume imaging by AFM evaluated the nanomechanics of all three cell types before, during, and after CytD treatment. Cytochalasin D disruption of cytoskeleton had marked effects on hMSCs and hMSC-Cys, in comparison with limited cytoskeleton disruption in hMSC-Obs, as confirmed qualitatively by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively by AFM. Treatment with CytD resulted in morphology changes of all cell types, with significant decreases in the observed Young's Moduli of hMSCs and hMSC-Cys.

Despite the multiple roles of adipose tissue in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis, adipocytes are thought to be largely homogenous with only 2 major subtypes recognized in humans so far. Here we report the existence and characteristics of 4 distinct human adipocyte subtypes, and of their respective mesenchymal progenitors. The phenotypes of these distinct adipocyte subtypes are differentially associated with key adipose tissue functions, including thermogenesis, lipid storage, and adipokine secretion. The transcriptomic signature of "brite/ beige" thermogenic adipocytes reveals mechanisms for iron accumulation and protection from oxidative stress, necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration upon activation. Importantly, this signature is enriched in human supraclavicular adipose tissue, confirming that these cells comprise thermogenic depots in vivo, and explain previous findings of a rate-limiting role of iron in adipose tissue browning. The mesenchymal progenitors that give rise to beige/brite adipocytes express a unique set of cytokines and transcriptional regulators involved in immune cell modulation of adipose tissue browning. Unexpectedly, we also find adipocyte subtypes specialized for high-level expression of the adipokines adiponectin or leptin, associated with distinct transcription factors previously implicated in adipocyte differentiation. The finding of a broad adipocyte repertoire derived from a distinct set of mesenchymal progenitors, and of the transcriptional regulators that can control their development, provides a framework for understanding human adipose tissue function and role in metabolic disease.},

A hallmark of differentiation is a pronounced change in cell shape, which is determined by dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Here we show that regulation of the transcriptional coactivator MKL1 (megakaryoblastic leukemia 1) by actin cytoskeleton dynamics drives adipocyte differentiation mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$), a master transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis. Induction of adipocyte differentiation results in disruption of actin stress fibres through downregulation of RhoA-ROCK signalling. The consequent rapid increase in monomeric G-actin leads to the interaction of G-actin with MKL1, which prevents nuclear translocation of MKL1 and allows expression of PPAR$\gamma$ followed by adipogenic differentiation. Moreover, we found that MKL1 and PPAR$\gamma$ act in a mutually antagonistic manner in the adipocytic differentiation programme. Our findings thus provide new mechanistic insight into the relation between the dynamics of cell shape and transcriptional regulation during cellular differentiation.},

abstract = {Stem cell differentiation underlies many fundamental processes such as development, tissue growth and regeneration, as well as disease progression. Understanding how stem cell differentiation is controlled in mixed cell populations is an important step in developing quantitative models of cell population dynamics. Here we focus on quantifying the role of cell-cell interactions in determining stem cell fate. Toward this, we monitor stem cell differentiation in adherent cultures on micropatterns and collect statistical cell fate data. Results show high cell fate variability and a bimodal probability distribution of stem cell fraction on small (80-140 $\mu$m diameter) micropatterns. On larger (225-500 $\mu$m diameter) micropatterns, the variability is also high but the distribution of the stem cell fraction becomes unimodal. Using a stochastic model, we analyze the differentiation dynamics and quantitatively determine the differentiation probability as a function of stem cell fraction. Results indicate that stem cells can interact and sense cellular composition in their immediate neighborhood and adjust their differentiation probability accordingly. Blocking epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) can diminish this cell-cell contact mediated sensing. For larger micropatterns, cell motility adds a spatial dimension to the picture. Taken together, we find stochasticity and cell-cell interactions are important factors in determining cell fate in mixed cell populations.},

To better comprehend neutrophil functions and their regulation, we provide a complete epigenetic overview, assessing important functional features of their differentiation stages from bone marrow-residing progenitors to mature circulating cells. Integration of chromatin modifications, methylation, and transcriptome dynamics reveals an enforced regulation of differentiation, for cellular functions such as release of proteases, respiratory burst, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. We observe an early establishment of the cytotoxic capability, while the signaling components that activate these antimicrobial mechanisms are transcribed at later stages, outside the bone marrow, thus preventing toxic effects in the bone marrow niche. Altogether, these data reveal how the developmental dynamics of the chromatin landscape orchestrate the daily production of a large number of neutrophils required for innate host defense and provide a comprehensive overview of differentiating human neutrophils. Grassi et al. report that the establishment of transcriptional enhancers drives neutrophil differentiation. Coordinated waves of gene expression establish the cytotoxic capability of these cells at early stages of maturation. A set of super-enhancers is specifically opened at the end of the differentiation process to control neutrophil activation.},

abstract = {Glutamate release from photoreceptor terminals is controlled by voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs). In humans, mutations in the Cacna1f gene, encoding the $\alpha$1F subunit of VDCCs, underlie the incomplete form of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2). These mutations impair synaptic transmission from rod and cone photoreceptors to bipolar cells. Here, we report anatomical and functional characterizations of the retina in the nob2 (no b-wave 2) mouse, a naturally occurring mutant caused by a null mutation in Cacna1f. Not surprisingly, the b-waves of both the light- and dark-adapted electroretinogram are abnormal in nob2 mice. The outer plexiform layer (OPL) is disorganized, with extension of ectopic neurites through the outer nuclear layer that originate from rod bipolar and horizontal cells, but not from hyperpolarizing bipolar cells. These ectopic neurites continue to express mGluR6, which is frequently associated with profiles that label with the presynaptic marker Ribeye, indicating potential points of ectopic synapse formation. However, the morphology of the presynaptic Ribeye-positive profiles is abnormal. While cone pedicles are present their morphology also appears compromised. Characterizations of visual responses in retinal ganglion cells in vivo, under photopic conditions, demonstrate that ON-center cells have a reduced dynamic range, although their basic center-surround organization is retained; no alteration in the responses of OFF-center cells was evident. These results indicate that nob2 mice are a valuable model in which to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with Cacna1f mutations causing CSNB2, and the subsequent effects on visual information processing. Further, the nob2 mouse represents a model system in which to define the signals that guide synapse formation and/or maintenance in the OPL.
